 Hey baby whatcha doin' this evening?
Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado,
And I iced down a six-pack.
Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama,
  Like 007 we can keep it covert.
  Undercover on the ground by the water
  Gonna get a little peace... on earth.
Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
  You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
  And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree.
  Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollenating,
  Dive on in like honey bees.
Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean.
  Hey baby won't you come with me?
Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers. Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama,
  Like 007 we can keep it covert.
  Undercover on the ground by the water
  Gonna get a little peace... on earth. Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
  You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers. Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
  And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree.
  Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollenating,

  Got a spot way back in the woods.

  Hey baby won't you come with me? Chorus:

You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers. Chorus:
  Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
  Got a spot way back in the woods.
  Sneak away for a couple of hours,
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers.
