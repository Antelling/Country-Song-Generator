 
Lately baby we've been lettin' pride get in the way
 Sayin' things that we don't mean, meanin' what we don't say
 Things have been so crazy that we lost our peace of mind
 But I think I know the perfect place to leave it all behind
 Chorus:
   They got sunshine every mornin'
   They got moonshine every night
   They got sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
   We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
   Baby, we won't have a care
   Plant our feet in the soft green grass
   Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of nowhere
   I said, the middle of nowhere
Life can get away sometimes before you know it's gone
   That solid ground can turn out to be sand you're standin' on
   We need a little time to find the fire we once knew
   Girl, and paradise is waitin' right down Highway 62
Repeat Chorus
Just you and me, the sky, the lakes and trees
   The middle of nowhere
   No baby, we won't want to leave - no
   That sunshine every mornin' 
   That moonshine every night
   That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside
   Yeah, we're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
   Baby, we won't have no cares
   Plant our feet in the soft green grass
   Smack dab, way out, back in
That sunshine every mornin'
   That moonshine every night
   That sweet love flowin' like a river off the mountainside 
   We're gonna kiss a little, fish a little
   Baby, we won't have a care
   Plant our feet in the soft green grass
   Smack dab, way out, back in the middle of no, no, no, nowhere
   Baby, get in the car
   You know it ain't far
   To the middle of nowhere
