 I used to believe that things would change but here we go again.
                      Riding a spinning carousel this circle never ends.
                      This kitchen table has seen it all before.
                    These walls are tired of standing, can’t hold us anymore. 1 mississippi I close my eyes.
                      2 mississippi I’m begging you that we can still survive.
                      3 mississippi no lookin’ back, gone for good and I know that
                      I won’t change my mind, oh, 3 mississippi is where I’m at tonight. We’re all out of second chances and all out of one more times.
                      There’s not a word we haven’t said nothing we have not tried.
                      My bones are aching from the weight I’m holding down.
                      I took all that I’m taking, I’m breaking, breaking down. 1 mississippi I close my eyes.
                      2 mississippi I’m begging you that we can still survive.
                      3 mississippi no lookin’ back, gone for good and I know that.
                      I won’t change my mind, oh yeah, 3 mississippi is where I’m at tonight. Hold my breath, close my eyes.
                      Goodbye. Woah,
                      1 mississippi I close my eyes.
                      2 mississippi I’m begging you that we can still survive.
                      3 mississippi no lookin’ back, gone for good and I know that.
                      I won’t change my mind, no I won’t change my mind, 3 mississippi is where I’m at tonight.
                      3 mississippi
                      3 mississippi
