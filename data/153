 Love is so beautiful
                      When everything is fine
                      But when it is like hers and mine
                      It lives and dies at least
                      Ten Thousand
                      Times Chorus:
                      Tell me something bad about Tulsa
                      How those old oil wells
                      Smell in the wind
                      Tell me something bad about Tulsa
                      So I won’t have to go back
                      Believing I belong there
                      Again Eyes as blue as Tulsa skis
                      I kept getting lost in when I met her
                      Hair like Oklahoma sand
                      I could run my hands through forever
                      But all good things must end
                      All rivers have to bend
                      I keep runnin’ out
                      But she keeps pullin’ me back in REPEAT CHORUS: Tell me something bad about Tulsa
                      So I won’t have to go back
                      Believing I belong there
                      Again
