 Never again, again.
Once more I'll let you back in
I know how the story ends
But I can't help myself
You'll break my heart I know
Through my tears I watch you go
Then just like it's always been
I'll say never again, again
Each time you leave
  I say I've had enough
  But I must be addicted
  To your kind of love
  I swear to myself
  I'm gonna stand my ground
  But one look at you
  Breaks my defenses down
And here comes never again, again
  Once more I'll let you back in
  And just like it's always been
  I'll say never again, again
And just like it's always been
  I'll say never again, again
 Each time you leave
  I say I've had enough
  But I must be addicted
  To your kind of love
  I swear to myself
  I'm gonna stand my ground
  But one look at you
  Breaks my defenses down And here comes never again, again
  Once more I'll let you back in
  And just like it's always been
  I'll say never again, again And just like it's always been
  I'll say never again, again
