 I've never done anything
                      That would ever bring a tear to your eye
                      I've never crossed the line
                      or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
                      But darling i'll admit
                      They're been times when i could have
                      The thing that kept me strong
                    Is the one thing that is always on My mind [Chorus] When I think about cheatin'
                      I just think about you leavin'
                      And how my world would fall to pieces
                      If I tossed your love away
                      Even when i'm tempted by some stranger
                      Oh there's never any danger
                      I just think about you leavin'
                      When I think about cheatin' There was a time in Abilene
                      When he said all the things I wanted to hear
                      It was hard to turn him down
                      Between the champaigne and the sound of whispers in my ear
                      But it just took one two-step with someone and I was missing you
                      He never had the chance cause I broke up the dance
                      Before the song was through [Chorus] When I think about cheatin'
                      I just think about you leavin'
                      And how my world would fall to pieces
                      If I tossed your love away
                      Even when i'm tempted by some stranger
                      Oh there's never any danger
                      I just think about you leavin'
                      When I think about cheatin'
