 (The Cause of All That)
I remember her
  Shakin' off the dust
  She could walk the walk, she was one of us
  When she went away, I went down that day
  Tried to cheer her, said you won't be missin' much
  All that I remember when I think of her back then
  Is a fast talkin', fun lovin' girl we called a friend
C H O R U S
  Hey, little Suzie just got back She still wearin' her baseball hat
  But struck out twice and came back to sit with me The
  game got called on account of the weather the rain came down we huddled together
  Thinkn' that life couldn't get better and
  When she walked away I noticed she was lookin' back
  I hope that I'm the cause of all that
An accidental touch
  Never meant so much
  Makes me realize
  That we're not close enough
  She used to talk so loud
  Now she's wispering
  Tryin' to draw me in
  And I'm listening
  She was always after something
  Now I wonder if it's me
  Maybe I'm just dreamin' but I call'em as I see'em

I hope that I'm the cause of all that
Look what she shares
  when she's playin' with her hair
  Tells me where she's comin' from
  And that it's goin' somewhere
Well hey, little Suzie just got back
  She still wearin' her baseball hat
  But struck out twice and came back to sit with me
  The game got called on account of the weather
  Rain came down & we huddled together
  I swear no uniform ever looked better
  And when she walked away I noticed she was lookin' back
  I hope that I'm the cause of all that
