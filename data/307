 You say you love me but you love me not
                      Something about true love that you must have forgot
                      To lose a memory I know just where to go
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
                    Somewhere between Texas and Mexico (Chorus:)
                      King fish are jumping  the moon is right
                      Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
                      Stars on the ocean will find me I know
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico South Padre Island to the Brownsville Bay
                      My heart is healing with each breaking way
                      But I got some real friends and they're ready to go
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico (Chorus:)
                      King fish are jumping the moon is right
                      Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
                      Stars on the ocean will find me I know
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
                    Somewhere between Texas and Mexico It's gonna take just a little more time
                      With a little help from the salt and a lime
                      Something about the wind and the sea sets a broken heart free out there yeah (Chorus:)
                      King fish are jumping the moon is right
                      Full throttle captain til the we're out of sight
                      Stars on the ocean will find me I know
                      Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
                    Somewhere between Texas and Mexico Somewhere between Texas and Mexico
