 Three or four miles down a red dirt road,
An' a green-eyed girl an' I used to go to see her.
I'd pull up the drive an' she'd jump in,
An' we'd head off down around the bend to the river.
Find a perfect spot an' throw a blanket on the ground:
Sit there talkin', till the sun went down, about nothin'.
Then one hot day in June,
The clouds rolled in right out of the blue.
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume,
In that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
  Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 
We were jumpin' an' a-runnin' an' a-laughin' out loud.
  The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah.
  We dove in the car, turned the radio on,
  Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie And The Jets.
  She turned an' looked my way,
  Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face.
  I reached out an' kissed her,
  Well, I remember that taste 
Of that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
  Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 
Sweet summer rain: it keeps blowin' through my mind.
  Even after all this time,
  I can't forget that moment,
  Yeah, we were fallin': 
Just like that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
  Yeah, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 
Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
  Yeah, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 
(I still remember,)
  (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 
To fade.  In that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
  Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
  Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)  We were jumpin' an' a-runnin' an' a-laughin' out loud.
  The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah.
