 Ain't it just like one of us to pick up the phone and call after a couple of drinks
                      And say "How've you been" and wonderin' that maybe you've been thinkin' 'bout me
                      And somewhere in the conversation an old familiar invitation always arrives
                    And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight. Everyone's known someone that they just can't help but want
                      And even though they just can't make it work out, well the ones who lingers on.
                      So once again we wind up in each other's arms, pretending that it's right
                      And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight. I know it's wrong,
                      But it ain't easy moving on.
                      So why can't two friends remember the good times once again? (Fiddle & steel solo) Tomorrow when I wake up, I'll be feeling a little guilty, a little sad.
                      Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad.
                      I guess that's what it is and late night calls like this that we try to find
                      And I may hate myself in the morning, but I'm gonna love you tonight.
                      And I may hate myself in the morning,
                      But I'm gonna love you tonight...
