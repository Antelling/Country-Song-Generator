 I got miles of trouble spreadin' far and wide
Bill on the table gettin' higher and higher
They just keep on comin', theres no end in sight
I'm just holding on tight...
I've got someone who loves me more then words can say
And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still hard to find faith..

Chorus:
But if you look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave You just might make me believe

Its just day to day tryin' to make ends meet 
What id give for an address on easy street 
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind 
Leave my troubles behind...

Chorus:
But if you look in my eyes
And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave You just might make me believe

I used to believe in use 
When times got tough 
Lately I'm afraid that even love is not enough

Chorus:
But if you can look in my eyes 
And tell me we'll be alright 
If you promise never to leave you just might make 
Oh, you just might make me 
You just might make me believe
