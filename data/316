 There's no gravity up here 
                      It's kind of hard to explain 
                      Every time I'm holding you 
                      It's like backwards rain - yeah  [Chorus]
                      You lift me up like a kite on a string 
                      Like a bird on newfound wings 
                      So high on you, I'm floating and flying around 
                      Your love is like fallin' upside down  You've got me so lightheaded 
                      It's a dizzy mood 
                      Spinning uncontrollably 
                      And gaining altitude  [Repeat Chorus] [Bridge]
                      Look at me 
                      Used to be, I could keep my feet on the ground 
                      When you said you could take me higher 
                      You weren't playing around 
                      (You weren't playing around)  [Repeat Chorus]
