 
When I'm walkin' by myself along the path that I should follow
I can see one reason why I'm happy I can face tomorrow
No one's gonna change my mind I'm gonna let my spirits climb
As high as I can go
I feel this way because I know
C H O R U S:
  There's somethin' 'bout heaven
  That brings you down to Earth
  Here in the moment
  With chapter and verse
  It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
  It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Suddenly I'm in a place I've never been and see no danger
  All you said was walk with me and you will never be a stranger
  All the world is here for me
  I opened up my eyes to see it
  that's the way I see it and it's all because of you
C H O R U S:
  There's somethin' 'bout heaven
  That brings you down to Earth
  Here in the moment
  With chapter and verse
  It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
Oh, its Heaven on Earth
  Sharing my life with you
  I am free cause I can see so far beyond the here and now
  Knowing Heaven waits for me just clears it up for me somehow
  Everything I see & hear, with everything you touch it's clear
  You are with me everywhere You never let me down
Cause there's somethin' 'bout Heaven
  That brings you down to Earth
  Here in the moment
  With chapter and verse
  It's all about livin' life for all it's worth
  It's Heaven on Earth sharing my life with you
