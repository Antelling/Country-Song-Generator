 A woman is a mystery
                      A man just cant understand
                      Sometimes all it takes to please her
                      Is the touch of your hand
                      N' Other times you got to take it slow
                      And hold her all night long
                      Heaven knows there's so many ways
                    A man can go wrong *Chorus*
                      Must be doin' somethin' right
                      I just heard ya sigh
                      N' Lean into my kiss
                      And close those deep blue need to eyes
                      Don't know what I did
                      To earn a love like this
                    But baby I must be doin' somethin' right Anywhere you wanna go
