 Well, I left for work in a hurry.
                      I rushed out the door without sayin' goodbye.
                      I didn't tell her I loved her this mornin', 
                    But I'll tell her tonight, I thought to myself. An' as I hurried off t'wards the highway,
                      This truck, outta nowhere, caught me by surprise.
                      He missed me by inches, an' my life passed in front of my eyes.
                      I guess that's the reason that they say: Dance every dance an' live each day,
                      As though it's your last,
                      An' tell those that you love how you feel,
                      Before it's too late.
                      Life is right here and now, 
                      We only go around just one time.
                      So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
                      For these are the days of our lives. Well as soon as my legs stopped a-shakin',
                      Took a deep breathe an' turned my car around.
                      Oh, I'm gonna take that vacation,
                      That we talked about, startin' right now. Although I know tomorrow will be here,
                      Tomorrow may not always be here for me.
                      'Cause nothin' in life is for certain but death's guaranteed.
                      And that's the reason that I say: Dance every dance an' live each day,
                      As though it's your last,
                      An' tell those that you love how you feel,
                      Before it's too late.
                      Life is right here and now, 
                      We only go around just one time.
                      So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
                      For these are the days of our lives. Instrumental break. Yeah, life is right here and now, 
                      We only go around just one time.
                      So embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
                      For these are the days of our lives.
                      Oh, embrace 'em, don't waste 'em,
                      For these are the days of our lives.
                      Yeah
