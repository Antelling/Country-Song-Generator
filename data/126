 I was lost in trouble and strife, I heard a voice and it changed my life
                      And now it's a brand new day, and I ain't afraid to say
                      You're not alone when you're down and out
                      And I think you know who I'm talking about
                      When I don't know how I'll get through
                    I ask myself what would Willie do What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
                      And a tour bus and some semi-trucks, thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
                      Well he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
                      If you don't believe me take a look at the family
                      And they'll tell you that it's true
                      When skies are gray what would Willie do Well long ago he came unto us, his words were simple but they went right through us
                      And the whole world sang along, but then they didn't want to hear his songs
                      He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
                      But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
                      And all of the people smiled, they came to hear him sing from miles
                      Like a miracle all those rednecks and hippies
                      From New York City down to Mississippi
                      Stood together and raised a brew
                      When it's all gone wrong what would Willie do You know sometimes I wonder when I ain't gettin' nowhere
                      What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear
                      And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
                      And he's got his problems just like any of us
                      Well he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
                      And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
                      And he'd take another deep breath...and he'd hold it
                      Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
                      Yeah hungry for all the things that he just can't change
                      Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom
                      And his wife sewed him up in the sheets and beat him with a broom and he forgave her
                      And you think that's rough, well then the IRS came and they took away all of his stuff
                      They took his golf course and his recording studio, and he just went out and did another show
                      So when it's all coming down on you
                      You better ask yourself what would Willie do What would Willie do, well he'd take a little time
                      And talk to old rooser as he'd drive on down the line
                      And there's millions down that road, and with a word he's gonna lighten their load
                      He loves all the people no matter their races
                      Hell he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
                      And that ain't easy to do, so when it's all too much, what would Willie
                      When the game gets tough what would Willie
                      When they call your bluff what would Willie do
