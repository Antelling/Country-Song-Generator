 
She’s sitting at the bar sipping on a beverage try to use your platinum card to get leverage
It don’t matter she’s got her own she got diamonds for buttons on her cellular phone.
She’s a cutie with a booty hotie with a body
Get on the dance floor gunna get naughty.
Don’t mean no harm just a little fun it don’t matter till breakfast till you see the sun
Cant find the key to the door were her heart is.
  Can’t find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
  There’s no equation for that rose she only knows when she goes
  She’s automatic
  She’s automatic
  She turns on when she wants to.
  Don’t give her no static
  She’s automatic
  She turns on when she wants to
  Automatic
The beat gets fast and you’re craving more
  Suddenly you make your way to the floor
  It’s a hick hop beat boy your body is pumped
  All the fine ladies shaking there buts
  Steep up to one ask her to dance
  It appears to you that she’s in a trance
  Take your time son play your position cause that’s the primary mission
Cant find the key to the door were her heart is.
  Can’t find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
