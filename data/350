 The car won't start, it's falling apart
                      I was late for work and my boss got smart
                      My pantyline shows got a run in my hose
                      My hair went flat man I hate that (hate that) Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
                      I realized I forgot my purse
                      With all this stress I must confess
                      This could be worse than PMS (Bridge)
                      This job ain't worth the pay
                      Can't wait til' the end of the day
                      Hey honey I'm on my way 
                      Hey (Hey) Hey (Hey) Hey Hey (chorus)
                      Honey I'm home and I had a hard day pour me a cold one oh 
                      right away
                      Rub my feet give me something to eat fiz me up with my favorite 
                      treat
                      Honey I'm back my head's killing me I need to relax and 
                      watch TV

                      Hey (Hey) Hey Honey I'm home Broke a nail opening the mail 
                      I cursed out loud cause it hurt like hell
                      This job's a pain its so mundane 
                      It sure don't stimulate my brain (Bridge) (chourus) Oh rub my neckbone (Chorus)
