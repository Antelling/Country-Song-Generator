 Baby, the clock on the wall is lying
 It's not really that late 
 It's too cold outside to be walking around 
 the streets of this town
 Anywhere if you think you have to be can wait
 [chorus]
   (Baby) Why don't you stay with me 
   Share all your secrets tonight 
   We can make believe the morning sun never will rise 
   Come and lay your head on this big brass bed 
   And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me, yeah
Baby, there's just no use in hiding
   The way that I am feeling right now
   With you standing there baby I swear I can't help but stare 
   Girl you're wearing me out, wearing me out
[chorus]
   (Baby) So why dont you stay with me share all your secrets tonight 
   We can make believe 
   the morning sun never will rise 
   Come and lay your head on this big brass bed 
   We'll be alright as long as you stay with me 
[Bridge]
   Baby don't go it looks like it's starting to rain 
   And it's so warm here in this apartment wrapped up in this blanket 
[chorus]
   (Baby) Why don't you stay with me 
   Share all your secrets tonight 
   We can make believe the morning sun never will rise 
   Come and lay your head on this big brass bed 
 And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me, yeah
Stay with me [chorus]
