 Boy, I didn’t mean to wake you.
                      I’m ok, yeah everything’s all right.
                      I’m in a phone booth outside of denver,
                    I drove all night. Well, I would’ve called you sooner,
                      But I knew you’d talk me out of this.
                      I’ve had a lot of miles to do some thinkin’,
                      Now it all-makes perfect sense. No I haven’t changed my mind,
                      I just called to say goodbye. You should see this mountain sunrise,
                      It looks just the way I dreamed.
                      I got my map of colorado in the seat right next to me.
                      If it ain’t packed in this ol’ plymouth,
                      It’s better left behind.
                      I just called to say goodbye. Boy, you know I’m gonna miss you....,
                      But we both know it’s for the best.
                      We just can’t keep usin’ each other,
                      As a safety net. I bet someday your gonna thank me.
                      When you finally get a taste of true love.
                      Baby, what we had was pretty good,
                      Just not enough. So here’s to tears we’ll never cry,
                      I just called to say goodbye. You should see this mountain sunrise,
