 I saw you walking down the street last night,
                      I saw him walking by your side,
                      I saw the way he stopped and held you tight,
                      I saw the look in your eyes,
                      Go on and tell him that you love him, 
                      Go on and show him he’s the one,
                    Go on and give him every sacred thing that you used to save for us, And see if I care,
                      Look at the way you’re tearing me apart baby,
                      See if I care,
                      Look at the tears falling in this heart baby,
                      Go on go on go on,
                      Yeah go on go on go on,
                      And see if I care, I still can hear the way you whisper, 
                      Softly in my ear,
                      I lay awake and I remember the way it felt to hold you near,
                      Go on and run your fingers through his hair,
                      Go on and lay by his side,
                      Go on and wrap him in your dark surrender,
                      And all your tender lies, And see if I care,
                      Look at the way you’re tearing me apart baby,
