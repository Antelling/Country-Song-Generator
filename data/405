 Yeah, Daddy said, "Son I'm sorry
                      You and Sheila ain't getting along
                      And if she's so dea set on leaving you, boy
                      Why ain't she already gone
                      Yeah, you better break out some sweet talking
                      'Cause I promise you you're gonna miss her
                      And I know what I'd do
                      If my baby left me
                    Pack up my things and go with her." (Chorus:)
                      You don't stay with the one you can live with
                      It's the one that you can't live without
                      It's the one that's got you tore up in pieces, boy
                      It's the one you keep talking about
                      Pride's a tough pill to swallow
                      It'll leave you lonely and cold and bitter
                      So what you need to do
                      If she's gonna leave you
                      You better pack up and go with her Daddy said, "Son, I'm through preaching
                      I've said all I'm gonna say
                      Now if you love her as much as I think you do
                      You're a fool if she gets away
                      She can go anywhere that she wants to
                      Dont give up, no don't quit her
                      Do like I did when your momma left me
                      Hell, I just packed up and went with her." (Chorus:)
