 Well there’s no more smokey bars in California,
                      There ain’t no wildlife left in Tennessee,
                      But I keep on living every song I’m singing,
                      And their trying to put an end to guys like me,
                      All that’s left in Bakersfield is a jukebox,
                      And it’s haunted by old songs and memories,
                      It’s getting hard to find a place to play my guitar,
                    And their trying to put an end to guys like me, Well, I’d like to find a place where love surrounds me,
                      Some town where they don’t mind me hanging around,
                      A place where life don’t move to fast,
                      And what you are is not a thing of the past,
                      Where you can land your dreams on solid ground,
                      Well, I’m sitting on a barstool down on Broadway,
                      Waiting for my turn to sing my dreams,
                      I’m just a California boy with my old guitar,
