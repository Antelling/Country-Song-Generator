 
Found an old box in the bottom of the closet,
 'Neath the bowlin' ball bag full of magazines.
 An' a school sweater with a ring in the pocket,
 From a first cigar; man, did I turn green?
 Hey, honey, come look at what I just found.
 This old picture of us when the carnival came to town.
 An' I was Superman, Tarzan:
   Thought I was a star in a rock an' roll band.
   An' you were Lois Lane, Letty Jane.
   I wasn't very good, but you were the biggest fan,
   Of the man that your Momma warned you not to trust:
   Now, baby, look at us. 
There's a bracelet that I made you at our homecomin' party:
   Bought a six-pack of Bud just to get the tabs.
   Took you home, an' you wore it proudly,
   But I got in trouble when you showed your Dad.
   Here's a sticker from the Dixon drive-in show.
   What movie was playin', we never did know.

Instrumental break.

   (Look at us.) 
Yeah, I was Superman, Tarzan:
   You were Lois Lane, Letty Jane.
   (Look at us.)
   Oh, baby, look at us.
   (Look at us.)
   Yeah, look at us. 
To fade.
