 
It’s cold in here fells like everything’s upside down
I can feel you talking but I can barley make out the sound
I been kicking around these parts, feels like a year
I’m gonna change this world if I ever get out of here
She wants to dress me in pink, paint’s my bedroom blue
And I just laugh to myself, because only I know the truth
This love is my only emotion
Haven’t learned any fear any pain
It’s kind of funny with all this commotion
I guess they’ve got me, to blame
And they don’t even know my name
And they don’t even know my name
Well I’ve never felt so ready, think it’s finally time
  Cause that big old world is waiting, and it’s mine all mine
  Just then everything got real quiet, it got real bright
  And a man took my hand said don’t worry, your mommas gonna be alright
  Then he opened the gate, & I followed him in
  Said you can wait right, here till it’s your turn again
  And his love is the one true emotion
  Heaven knows no fear no pain
  I never got to set my wheels in motion
  But they loved me just the same
  And they never even knew name
  Didn’t even know my name
  You loved me just the same
  And you didn’t even know my name
 Well I’ve never felt so ready, think it’s finally time
  Cause that big old world is waiting, and it’s mine all mine
  Just then everything got real quiet, it got real bright
  And a man took my hand said don’t worry, your mommas gonna be alright
  Then he opened the gate, & I followed him in
  Said you can wait right, here till it’s your turn again
  And his love is the one true emotion
  Heaven knows no fear no pain
  I never got to set my wheels in motion
  But they loved me just the same
  And they never even knew name
  Didn’t even know my name
  You loved me just the same
  And you didn’t even know my name
