 It was Indiana, a summer day
                      and I was three years old
                      My momma said go out to play
                      well, I did what I was told
                      She never saw it comin' 
                      when I turned the sprinkler on
                      She looked up from the dishes
                    and right there in the front lawn Nothin' but cowboy boots
                      sets your spirit free
                      That wild wild western birthday suit
                      is the remedy for modesty
                      It ain't proper, it ain't cool
                      but folks remember what you do
                      in nothin', whoa nothin', but cowboy boots Well all it takes, when you're eighteen
                      is your buddy's double dare
                      It was eight o'clock on a friday night
                      in the middle of Town Square
                      Couldn't hear the sirens 
                      'cause so many people cheered
                      When the sheriff showed up,
                      I was grinnin' ear to ear In nothin' but cowboy boots
                      sets your spirit free
                      That wild wild western birthday suit
                      is the remedy for modesty
                      It ain't proper, it ain't cool
                      but folks remember what you do
                      in nothin', whoa nothin', but cowboy boots I came home late tonight
                      You just smiled at my surprise
                      I see ya comin' down the hall, whoa
                      in nothin', whoa Nothin' but cowboy boots
                      sets your spirit free
                      That wild wild western birthday suit
                      is the remedy for modesty
                      It ain't proper, it ain't cool
                      but folks remember what you do
                      in nothin', whoa nothin',
                      no no nothin', but those cowboy boots
                      oh no no nothin', no 
                      nothin' but those cowboy boots
