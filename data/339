 This might come as quite a shock 
                      But I’ve given it a lot of thought 
                      This thing that’s come between us 
                      Can’t be ignored. 
                      I’ve taken all I can 
                      This is where it’s gotta end 
                    Cuz I can’t be your friend anymore,  And I can’t be accused 
                      Of not being there for you 
                      How many nights have you shown up at my door 
                      I hope you understand 
                      That this wasn’t in my plans 
                      But I can’t be your friend anymore  CHORUS: 
                      And it’s killin’ me to know you without 
                      Having a chance to hold you 
                      And all I wanna do is show you how I 
                      Really feel inside 
                      You can run to me 
                      You can laugh at me 
                      Or you can walk right out that door 
                      But I can’t be your friend anymore.  So baby now it’s up to you 
                      Do I win or do I lose, 
                      Will my heart fly or lye broken on the floor? 
                      Well take me as I am, 
                      Cuz I wanna be your man 
                      But I can’t be your friend anymore.  CHORUS: 
                      And it’s killin’ me to know you without 
                      Having a chance to hold you 
                      And all I wanna do is show you how I 
                      Really feel inside 
                      You run to me 
                      You can laugh at me 
                      Or you can walk right out that door 
                      But I can’t be just friends anymore 
                      We can’t be just friends anymore.
