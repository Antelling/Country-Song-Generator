 You never looked so good
                      as you did last night,
                      underneath the city lights,
                      there walking with your friend,
                      laughing at the moon.
                      I swear you looked right through me.
                      But I’m still living with your goodbye,
                      and you’re just going on with your life. How can you just walk on by
                      without one tear in your eye?
                      Don’t you have the slightest feelings left for me?
                      Maybe that’s just your way
                      of dealing with the pain,
                      forgetting everything
                      between our rise and fall
                      like we never loved at all. You, I hear you’re doing fine.
                      Seems like you’re doing well
                      as far as I can tell.
                      Time is leaving us behind,
                      (time – leaving us behind)
                      another week has passed
                      and still I haven’t laughed yet.
                      So tell me, what your secret is
                      (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
                      to letting go, letting go like you did,
                      like you did. How can you just walk on by
                      without one tear in your eye?
                      Don’t you have the slightest feelings left for me?
                      Maybe that’s just your way
                      of dealing with the pain,
                      forgetting everything
                      between our rise and fall
                      like we never loved at all. Did you forget the magic?
                      Did you forget the passion?
                      Oh, and did you ever miss me,
                      and long to kiss me?
                      Oh baby, baby. Maybe that’s just your way
                      of dealing with the pain,
                      forgetting everything
                      between our rise and fall
                      like we never loved at all.
