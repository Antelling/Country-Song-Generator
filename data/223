 
No one raised their hand that day when they asked for volunteers. 
 He got picked out by default he was the only daddy there.
 They said we know what you're thinking 
 Choose someone else instead but this league is built on coaches 
 who stood right there and said...
 Not Me not me no way with this job of mine i could never find the time not me not me 
   The world becomes a better place when
   someone stands and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
The judge says you're the oldest may choose a legal guardian 
   I'm sorry that you lost your folks but theres no next of kin
   Two brothers and a sister she knew how hard it would be but she softly said 
   I'll raise them while a voice inside her screamed....
Not me Not me I can't believe what's happening 
   This isn't how it's supposed to be Not me not me 
   The world becomes a better place when someone stands 
   and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
A young captain at attention, a star pin on his chest 
   He recalls the battle while the final roll call's read 
   They were the finest soldiers it was my priviledge to lead 
   They deserve the medals the men who died not me
Not me not me I just did what i was called to do you'd do the same if it was you 
   Not me not me 
   The world becomes a better place when someone stands 
   and leads the way steps forward when they'd rather say not me
Yeah steps forward when they'd rather say Not me
Not me
   Not me
