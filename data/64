 
I don't have to put on make up,
I don't have to do my hair.
An'd when I open up that Hagen Daz,
Well, I don't have to share.
An' there's no one there to notice,
If I gain a couple a-pounds:
An' that's the upside of bein' down.
Well, I've got twice the closet space,
  That I can fill up with new shoes.
  And I can paint the bedroom pretty pink,
  With lacy curtains if I choose.
  An' I won't have to deal with fishin' gear,
  Muddy boots laying round:
  That's the upside of being down.
Days when I'm feelin' low, yeah, I got 'em:
  When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground.
  But there's only one place left to go when you're at the bottom,
  An' that's the upside of being down.
I can let my dog jump on the bed,
  An' curl up next to me at night.
  An' I don't have to lose an argument,
  'Cause now I'm always right.
  An' I can dance with who I want to,
  When I go out on the town:
  An' that's the upside of being down.
Days when I'm feelin' low, yeah, I got 'em:
  When my tears won't stop fallin' to the ground.
  But there's only one place left to go when you're at the bottom,
  An' that's the upside of being down.
