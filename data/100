 
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I cut my teeth on an old lawn-mower,
  Cleanin' out gutters, doin' other people's chores.
  After school. weekends an' holidays.
  Yeah, ever since then, all I've known,
  Is my nose on fire from the grindstone,
  A lifetime built on an hourly wage.
  Muscled arms an' calloused hands:
  I am the workin' man.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
  Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
  Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
  No matter what, it still goes on.
  Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
  Somebody's gotta fix it:
  I am the workin' man,
  Yes, I am.
Now I've laid asphalt an' I've laid brick:
  I've hung sheet, rock and shovelled sh**,
  Eat my lunch down at the Kwickie-Mart.
  Oh, I fill the potholes on easy-street,
  So show some respect when you look at me.
  I'm just out here tryin' to do my part.
  An' I sleep good when the day comes to an end,
  'Cause I am the workin' man.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
  Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
  Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
  No matter what, it still goes on.
  Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
  Somebody's gotta fix it:
  I am the workin' man.
I can swing a hammer, turn a wrench,
  Build a tower, dig a ditch,
  Drive a truck that shakes the earth,
  Somebody's gotta do the dirty work.
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
  Gotta keep this world turnin' 'round.
  Blazin' hot, freezin' cold:
  No matter what, it still goes on.
  Pushin', pullin', pourin', mixin',
  Somebody's gotta fix it:
  I am...
  I am the workin' man.
Yes I am,
  Oh. the workin' man.
