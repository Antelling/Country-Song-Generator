 You got a great apartment and a real nice car
The job you always wanted, you're ganna go far
You got everything you need in this world, but you got the wrong girl
Everybodys lookin' cause she looks so hot
You don't know it yet, but I know what you got
Go ahead and give it a whirl but you got the wrong girl
If you're lookin for love, you're lookin to hard
You can't see that what you need is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds and you missed a pearl
Yea you got the wrong girl
Does she like fishin, four wheelin in the woods?
Does she get her hands greasy up under neith the hood?
I bet she never listens to Merle
Yea you got the wrong girl
If you're lookin for love, you're lookin to hard
you can't see that what you need is right in your back yard
You were blinded by diamonds and you missed a pearl
You got the wrong girl
Yea you got the wrong girl
Yea you got the wrong girl
You got the wrong girl
