 Got a date a week from Friday with the Preacher's son,
Everybody says he's crazy, I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson when the summer came,
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on it seems I'm doing more of that these days
(Chorus:)
  I probably wouldn't be this way
  I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
  I never pictured every minute without you in it,
  Oh you left so fast,
  Sometimes I see you standing there
  Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
  Sometimes I feel I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
  God give me moments grace
  Cause if I'd nevber seen your face
  I probably wouldn't be this way
Momma says that I just shouldn't speak to you,
  Susan says that I should just move on,
  You oughta see the way these people look at me,
  When they see me 'round here talking to this stone,
  Everybody thinks I've lost my mind but I just take it day by day
(Chorus:)
  I probably wouldn't be this way
  I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
  I never pictured every minute without you in it,
  Oh you left so fast,
  Sometimes I see you standing there
  Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
  Sometimes I feel I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
  God give me moments grace
  Cause if I'd nevber seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't be this way,
  I probably wouldn't hurt so bad,
  I never pictured every minute without you in it,
  Oh you left so fast,
  Sometimes I see you standing there,
  Sometimes I feel an angels touch
  Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
  God give me a moments grace
  Cause if I'd never see your face
  I probably woudln't be this way
  I probably wouldn't be this way
Got a date a week from a Friday with the Preacher's son,
  Everybody says I'm crazy, guess I'll have to see (Chorus:)
  I probably wouldn't be this way

  Oh you left so fast,
  Sometimes I see you standing there
