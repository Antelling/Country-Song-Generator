 I've been up all night long 
                      Just waitin' on the sun
                      I've given up damn the dawn
                      It ain't never gonna come
                    Something's wrong, as long as you're gone Chorus:
                      I'm not gonna sleep til I touch your face
                      Baby not a wink I could go for days
                      If you ever needed to see me down on my knees
                      Take a look at me, baby I can't sleep Remember when you said you wouldn't last
                      I couldn't swallow my pride
                      Whoa it's sinkin' in, baby losin' you has
                      Finally opened my eyes
                      I'm wide awake, as long as it takes CHORUS
