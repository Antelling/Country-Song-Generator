 It was noon time, down time, break time, summer time, Miller time, anytime:
                      She was looking pretty fine.
                      Red light, green light, go: all fired upside, downtown:
                      She was shaking me all around.
                      I was tuned in, going nowhere, second wind,
                    Jonesing, drooling, feeling good, if you would.  Oh yeah, by the way she moves,
  She's got me rollin' in dirt: in a white t-shirt,
  Breaker, Breaker one-nine, she's a big ol' flirt.
  By now she's got me pretty tied up, tied down,
  Any way I choose, I got nothin' to lose. In like Flynn, I was looking for the win,
                      Just trying anything, hey,
                      Baby, where you been?
                      All my life I've been looking for someone like you.
                      Falling head over heels,
                      Hey what can I do?  Oh yeah, by the way she moves,
  She's got me rollin' in dirt: in a white t-shirt,
  Breaker, Breaker one-nine, she's a big ol' flirt.
  By now she's got me pretty tied up, tied down,
  Any way I choose, I got nothin' to lose.  Now, I'm in the fast lane goin' ninety-eight.
  By now, I know she can smooth operate me.
  I know now, she's no goody-two-shoes,
  But hey, I got myself nothin' to lose.  Instrumental break.  Oh yeah, by the way she moves,
  She's got me rollin' in dirt: in a white t-shirt,
  Breaker, Breaker one-nine, she's a big ol' flirt.

                      Just trying anything, hey baby where you been?
                      All my life I've been looking for someone like you.
