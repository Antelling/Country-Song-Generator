 (Chorus:)
                      I feel no shame
                      I'm proud of where I came from
                      I was born and raised in the boondocks
                      One thing I know
                      No matter where I go
                    I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks And I can feel
                      That muddy water running through my veins
                      And I can hear that lullaby of a midnight train
                      It sings to me and it sounds familiar (Chorus:)
                      I feel no shame
                      I'm proud of where I came from
                      I was born and raised in the boondocks
                      One thing I know
                      No matter where I go
                    I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks And I can taste
                      That honeysuckle and it's still so sweet
                      When it grows wild
                      On the banks down at old camp creek
                      Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowing (Chorus:)
                      I feel no shame
                      I'm proud of where I came from
                      I was born and raised in the boondocks
                      One thing I know
                      No matter where I go
                    I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks It's where I learned about living
                      It's where I learned about love
                      It's where I learned about working hard
                      And having a little was just enough It's where I learned about Jesus
                      And knowing where I stand
                      You can take it or leave it, this is me
                      This is who I am Give me a tin roof
                      A front porch and a gravel road
                      And that's home to me
                      It feels like home to me (Chorus) I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks You get a line, I'll get a pole
                      We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole
                      Five-card poker on a Saturday night
                      Church on Sunday morning (2x)
                      You get a line, I'll get a pole
                      We'll go fishing in the crawfish hole
                      (Down in the boondocks)
                      Five-card poker on a Saturday night
                      Church on Sunday morning Say a little prayer for me
