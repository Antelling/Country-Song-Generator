 Hope is an anchor and love is a ship, time is the ocean and life is a trip
                      You don't know where you're going, ‘till you know where you're at
                      And if you can't read the stars, well you better have a map
                      A compass and a conscience, so you don’t get lost at sea
                    Or on some lonely island, where no one wants to be From the beginning of creation, I think our maker had a plan
                      For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
                      And let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind
                      To the beaches in a world where we have never been
                      And we'll climb up on a mountain, y'all we'll let our voices ring
                      Those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing Whoa, my, my
                      I'll see you on the other side
                      If I make it
                      And it might be a long hard ride
                      But I’m gonna take it
                      Sometimes it seems that I don’t have a prayer
                      Let the weather take me anywhere
                      But I know that I wanna go
                      Where the streets are gold
                    ‘Cause you'll be there
                      Oh, my , my
 You don’t bring nothing with you here
                      And you can’t take nothing back
                      I ain’t never seen a hearse, with a luggage rack
                      So I've torn my knees up prayin’
                      Scarred my back from fallin’ down
                      Spent so much time flying high, till I’m face first in the ground
                      So if you're up there watchin’ me, would you talk to God and say,
                      Tell him I might need a hand to see you both someday Whoa, my, my
                      So I'll see you on the other side
                      If I make it
                      And it might be a long hard ride
                      But I’m gonna take it
                      Sometimes it seems that I don’t have a prayer
                      Let the weather take me anywhere
                      But I know that I wanna go
                      Where the streets are gold
                    ‘Cause you'll be there
                      Oh, my , my
                      Cause you'll be there
                      Oh, my ,my
