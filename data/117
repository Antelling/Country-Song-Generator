 Well high school got me educated
                      Still when I graduated
                    I didn't have a clue Did a stand in the Navy
                      They did they're best to break me
                      Somehow I made it through I've had some hard knocks
                      I've been around the block
                      But baby I believe
                      That love and you made a man of me Raising hell racing cars
                      Closing down the local bars
                      That what I used to do Family told me settle down
                      Find yourself some solid ground
                      Where you can put down some roots Back then I thought love
                      Was only sissy stuff
                      But now I see
                      That love and you made a man of me Love and you made a man of me Don't know what it is you do
                      But everytime I'm holding you
                      I know what my heart is for I'm the one you lean on
                      Gotta be strong
                      It's not just about me anymore Well goodbye to my blind and imature days
                      Love and you made a man of me
                      Made a man of me, yeah
                      Made a man of me, wow I'd still be only lost and lonely
                      Can't ya see
                      That love and you made a man of me
