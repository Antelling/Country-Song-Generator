 His name was Steve,
                      Her name was Gina,
                      (spoken) You've never been here before have you?
                      They met at a bar called Cowboy Outcove Cantena,
                      He was a salesman from South Dakota,
                      She was a first grade school teacher Pheonix Arizona,
                      (Spoken) No, My first time here
                      They started dancing and it got real hot,
                      Then it spilled over to the parking lot,
                      One more tequila then we're falling in love,
                    One night together in Love (Chorus)
                      Don't bite off more than you can chew,
                      There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
                      Just remember when you let it all go,
                      What happens in Mexico,
                      Stays in Mexico He woke up in the morning and he made a little tellephone call,
                      To check on his wife and his kids back at home in Souix Falls,
                      She hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind,
                      (spoken) What am I doing?
                      He knew it was the first time Geena had ever crossed that line,
                      They walked down to the beach and started drinking again,
                      Jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim,
                      One more margarita then we're falling in love,
                      One night together in love (Chorus)
                      Don't bite off more than you can chew,
                      There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
                      Just remember when you let it all go,
                      What happens in Mexico,
                    Stays in Mexico Oh Mexico Waiting at the bar at the terminal gate,
                      She says 'Steve I gotta go, I'm going to miss my plane'
                      He said one more tequila before you climb on up,
                      She said more night together in love (Chorus)
                      Don't bite off more than you can chew,
                      There's things down here the devil himself wouldn't do,
                      Just remember when you let it all go,
                      What happens in Mexico,
                    Stays in Mexico Stays in Mexico,
                      Stays in Mexico,
