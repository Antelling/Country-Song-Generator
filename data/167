 [Chorus] Well I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago
                      I found an equalizer that makes his memory a no show
                      And I won't be jonesin'
                      for his loving anymore
                      Cause I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago I dropped a quarter played "Golded Ring" on the juke box
                      Placed my order with the guy behind the bar
                      And when he haded me a cold one, I said "Keep the change, Darlin'"
                      And as I drank it down I felt the healing start. [Repeat Chorus] When he left me he took my brand new Silverado
                      I started thumbin' and I finally hitched a ride
                      I just came in here to drink a beer and watch the rednecks fight
                      Now I don't feel so bad going home alone tonight [Repeat chorus] And I won't be jonesin' for his lovin' any more
                      'Cause I'm one bud wiser than I was a minute ago
                      Yes I'm one bud wiser...
