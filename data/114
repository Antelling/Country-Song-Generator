 I can’t stop your heart from breaking,
                      Can’t make right mistakes we’ve made,
                      Can’t dry your crying eyes,
                      For my little angels sake,
                      I can’t make the sun keep smiling,
                      Or blow away the clouds, 
                      There’s some things in this old world girl,
                    I can’t do nothing bout, But I can love you,
                      Like I’ve always done, 
                      And when the hard times come a knocking,
                      Honey you won’t ever see me run,
                      I won’t leave you,
                      When you need a friend,
                      Can’t make the bad days that much better,
                      Baby than they’ve ever been, 
                      But I can love you, Can’t hold back the ocean waves,
                      Or stop a sinking ship,
                      Can’t make a mountain move,
                      Or tell you how to live, But I can love you,
                      Like I’ve always done, 
                      And when the hard times come a knocking,
                      Honey you won’t ever see me run,
                      I won’t leave you,
                      When you need a friend,
                      Can’t make the bad days that much better,
                      Baby than they’ve ever been, 
                      But I can love you, And I won’t leave you,
                      When you need a friend,
                      Can’t make the bad days that much better,
                      Baby than they’ve ever been, 
                      But I can love you,
                      But I can love you.
