 Smoky old bars, bright neon lights
                      Good ole boys and girls of the night
                      An ice cold beer and a good shot of brandy
                      I've always had a sweet tooth
                    For the devil's candy And I've fought it all my life
                      And the battle's now a war
                      But I'll get up tomorrow
                      And I'll fight it all once more
                      I want to do what's right
                      But I'll never understand me
                      I've always had a sweet tooth
                      For the devil's candy Well I've played the cards, and I've rolled the dice
                      Well I gave up heaven for a fool's paradise
                      I once lost an angel when a bad girl was handy
                      I've always had a sweet tooth
                      For the devil's candy And I've fought it all my life
                      And the battle's now a war
                      But I'll get up tomorrow
                      And I'll fight it all once more
                      I want to do what's right
                      But I'll never understand me
                      I've always had a sweet tooth
                      For the devil's candy I want to do what's right
                      But I'll never understand me
                      I've always had a sweet tooth
                      For the devil's candy
                      Yes I've always had a sweet tooth
                      For the devil's candy
