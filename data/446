 I hardly ever think about her. 
                      I seldom say "I can't live without her", 
                      Till I hold a drink an' sit at the bar. 
                      A sip an' it all goes straight to my heart. 
                      Like that song on the jukebox, 
                      Her memory starts to play. 
                      Guess I still want her, 
                    In a whiskey kind of way.  An' when I'm sober, I say it's over, 
                      She can't get to me. 
                      I'm a million miles away from her memory. 
                      They say the truth comes out when you're drinkin': 
                      I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day. 
                      Guess I still want her in a whiskey kind of way.  I talk, to Joe behind the counter, 
                      And every fool I meet, about her. 
                      I steel my heart to anyone, 
                      Who'll buy a drink for the lonely one. 
                      What ran her off's had her runnin' through my mind all day. 
                      Guess I still need her in a whiskey kind of way.  An' when I'm sober, I say: "It's over, 
                    "She can't get to me. 
                    "I'm a million miles away from her memory." 
                      They say the truth comes out when you're drinkin': 
                      I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day. 
                      Guess I still love her in a whiskey kind of way.  Oh, don't the truth comes out when you're drinkin': 
                      I've been drinkin' 'bout her all day. 
                      Guess I still love her in a whiskey kind of way.
