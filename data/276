 There's a cold feelin'
Runnin' up and down my spine
It seems to say "We're Just Wastin'Time"
It's like a bad movie
One I wish I'd never seen
The plot gets old, Do you know what mean?
Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
  And baby I'm good as gone
On a lost highway
  I don't know how I got where I am
  Take the next splitsville exit ramp
  It's like a cheap vacation
  One I thought we planned very well
  Now we've checked out of the lovely love hotel
  Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is
Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone
Baby I'm gone, I'm gone Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
  And baby I'm good as gone On a lost highway
  I don't know how I got where I am
  Take the next splitsville exit ramp
  It's like a cheap vacation
  One I thought we planned very well
  Now we've checked out of the lovely love hotel
  Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone Don't try to tell me it ain't what it is Chorus:
  I'm Good
  I'm good at seein' the signs
  I'm good at reading between the lines
  No use in hangin' on
  'Cause you're good to go
And baby I'm good as gone Baby I'm gone, I'm gone
