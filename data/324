 I was lost in darkness and sinking sand 
                      Well I was barely nothing, a broken man 
                      But you picked up the pieces of my heart in your hand 
                      Then you came and showed to me love's second chance  [Chorus]
                      Shine on, shine on, shine on me 
                      Whenever something's missing 
                      You're exactly what I need 
                      Your love has shown me the light and now I finally see 
                      So shine on, shine on, shine on me, yeah  Lord knows that I'm not perfect but I sure do try 
                      And I see the man that I can be in your eyes 
                      Well there are times I still get lost in yesterday 
                      But you put the past behind me and you light my way  [Repeat Chorus] Shine on (let your love shine) 
                      Shine on (on me) 
                      Shine all your love on me, yeah 
                      (Your love on me) 
                      Shine all your love on me, yeah  [Repeat Chorus] Shine on, shine on, shine on me 
                      Won't you keep on shining, yeah 
                      Won't you keep on shining your love 
                      Down on me, baby 
                      Won`t you keep on shining, yeah 
                      Won`t you keep on shining your love 
                      Yeah, you're exactly what I need, baby 
                      Yeah, you are
