 He can't remember the times that he thought
                      Does my daddy love me?
                      Probably not
                      But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did
                      Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him He guesses he saw him about once a year
                      He could still feel the way he felt
                      Standing in tears
                      Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
                      Wispering daddy, I wan't you to know Chorus
                      I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
                      To make up your mind, do you love me to?
                      However long it takes
                      I'm never giving up
                      No matter what, I love you this much He grew to hate him for what he had done
                      'Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son
                      He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died
                      The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried Chorus Half way through the service
                      While the choir sand a hymn
                      He looked up above the preacher
                      And he sat and stared at him He said "Forgive me father"
                      When he realized
                      That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
                      His arms were stretched out as far as they'd go
                      Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know Chorus
