 i'm meeting my buddies out on the lake 
                      we're headin out to a special place 
                      we love that just a few folks know 
                      there's no signing up, no monthly dues 
                      take your johnson, your mercury or your evinrude and fire it up 
                      meet us out at party cove 
                      come on in' the waters fine 
                    just idle on over and toss us a line  (Chorus)
                      basstrackers, bayliners and a party barge, 
                      strung together like a floating trailer park anchored out and gettin loud 
                      all summer long side by side there's five
  houseboat front porches astroturf, 
  lawn chairs and tiki torches 
  regular joes rocking the boat that's us 
  the redneck yacht club  bermuda's' flip-flops and a tank top tan 
                      popped his first top at ten a.m., thats bob 
                      he's our president 
                      we're checking out the girls on the upper deck rubbin' in 15 spf, its hot 
                      everybody's jumpin' in 
                      later on when the sun goes down 
                      we'll pull out the jar and the old guitar 
                      and pass'em around  (Chorus)
                      basstrackers, bayliners and a party barge, 
                      strung together like a floating trailer park anchored out and gettin loud 
                      all summer long side by side there's five
                      houseboat front porches astroturf, 
                      lawn chairs and tiki torches 
                      regular joes rocking the boat that's us 
                    the redneck yacht club  when the party's over and we're all alone 
                      well be making waves in a no wake zone  (Chorus)
                      basstrackers, bayliners and a party barge, 
                      strung together like a floating trailer park anchored out and gettin loud 
                      all summer long side by side there's five
                      houseboat front porches astroturf, 
                      lawn chairs and tiki torches 
                      regular joes rocking the boat that's us 
                    the redneck yacht club
