                      been the barbie doll type 
                      no I can't swig that sweet champaigne 
                      I'd rather drink beer all night 
                      In a tavern or in a honky tonk 
                      I want a 4 wheel drive tailgate 
                      I've got posters on my wall of Skynard, Kid and Straight 
                      Some people look down on my 
                      But I don't give a rip 
                    I stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby in on my hip  Cause I'm redneck woman 
                      I aint no high class broad 
                      I'm just a product of my rasin' 
                      And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw" 
                      And I keep my christmas lights on my front porch all year long 
                      And I know all the words to every Charle Daniels song 
                      So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country

                      You might think I'm trashy 
                      A little too hard core 
                      But get in my neck of the woods
