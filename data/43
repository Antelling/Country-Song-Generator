 Someday I'm gonna be famous,
                      Do I have talent, well, no.
                      These days you don't really need it,
                      Thanks to reality shows  Can't Wait to date a supermodel,
                      Can't Wait to sue my dad.
                      Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
                      On my way to rehab....  Chorus-
                      Cause when you're a Celebrity
                      It's adios reality
                      You' can act just like a fool
                      People think you're cool
                      Just cause your on TV.
                      I can throw major fits
                      When my latte isn't just how I like it
                      They say I've gone insane, 
                      I'll blame it on the fame,
                      And the pressures that it goes with
                      Being a Celebrity
                      uh huh  I get to cry to Barbara Walters,
                      When Things don't go my way.
                      I'll get community service
                      No matter which law I break  I'll make the supermarket tabloids,
                      They'll write some awful stuff
                      But the more they run my name down, 
                      THE MORE MY PRICE GOES UP!  Chorus-
                      Cause when you're a Celebrity,
                      It's adios reality.
                      No matter what you do,
                      People think you're cool,
                      Just cause you're on TV.
                      I can fall in and out of love,
                      Have marriages that barely last a month.
                      When they go down the drain
                      I'll blame it on fame
                      And say it's just so tough.
                      Being a Celebrity  So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
                      To the land of fun in the sun
                      We'll be real world bachelors
                      Jackass Millionaires
                      Hey, Hey, Hollywood
                      Here we come!  Chorus-
                      Yeah, When you're a Celebrity
                      It's adios reality
                      No matter what you do,
                      People think you're cool,
                      Just cause you're on t.v.
                      ...Being a Celebrity
