 
Lonely sound of distant thunder
Stirs my restless sleep
And the dream that i was lost in
Slips away
Of a young son and his mama
So innocent back then
Would she even reckognise her boy today
(Chorus:)
  Cause i have fought into the darkness
  And i've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
  And in my heart I wish i could believe
  That who i was, is who i am
I've crossed mountains, hills, and valleys
  From sea to shining sea
  Barren sands to blinding snow
  I held my brother as he laid dieing
  Beside me in some field
  Said a prayer, and let him go
(Chorus:)
  And i have fought into the darkness
  I've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
  And in my heart I wish i could believe
  That who i was, is who i am
I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting go)
  Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting go)
Now with all my trials behind me
  I'm so blessed to cast my eyes
  On my family and my home
  And with faith i faced my demons
  When God was on our side
  All that's left, is letting go
I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
  Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
 (Chorus:)
  Cause i have fought into the darkness
  And i've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
  And in my heart I wish i could believe
  That who i was, is who i am I've crossed mountains, hills, and valleys
  From sea to shining sea
  Barren sands to blinding snow
  I held my brother as he laid dieing
  Beside me in some field
  Said a prayer, and let him go (Chorus:)
  And i have fought into the darkness
  I've spilled blood, with these 2 hands
  And in my heart I wish i could believe
  That who i was, is who i am I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting go)
  Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting go) Now with all my trials behind me
  I'm so blessed to cast my eyes
  On my family and my home
  And with faith i faced my demons
  When God was on our side
  All that's left, is letting go I'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
  Well i'm letting go (i'm letting go)
  Letting go (i'm letting, letting go)
