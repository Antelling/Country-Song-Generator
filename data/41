 
Things get in the way 
The rush of everyday 
Ordinary stuff we all get into 
Wouldn't it be sad, if all you ever had 
was a granite epitaph that said 'I meant to'
CHORUS: 
So any pretty woman I didn't take the time to kiss 
  Any crazy thing I didn't do, 'I meant to' 
Any dirty liar I didn't stare right in the eye 
  and make him tell the naked truth, 'I meant to' 
I'm always on the run some things get lost some get done 
  But if I didn't have all the fun I meant to, 'I meant to' 
And if I never came out and said to each and everyone I love, how much I really do, 'I meant to' 
VERSE 2 
Maybe this one chance 
  Is all we really have 
  Maybe all you got, is what you get to 
  Well I ain't gonna cry 
  I'll give it my best try 
  Then kiss the world goodbye and say 'I meant to' 
REPEAT CHORUS 
I meant to 
  I meant to
