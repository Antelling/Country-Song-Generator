 Let’s take a rest
                      Your kisses take my breath
                      You are the best
                    It’s never been like this Chorus:
                      She used to say that to me
                      Over and over so sweet
                      She’ll tell you she’ll never leave
                      She used to say that to me It thrills you so
                      When she whispers soft and low
                    “Please hold me tight
                      I need your love tonight” Repeat Chorus “I’m yours,” she sighs
                      And she means it at the time
                      But someday she’ll go
                      If you’re wonderin’ how I know She used to say that to me
                      Over and over so sweet
                      She’ll tell you she’ll never leave
                      She used to say that
                      She used to say that to me
                      Over and over so sweet
                      She’ll tell you she’ll never leave
                      She used to say that to me She used to say that to me
