 He drinks, he smokes,
                      He curses, swears and tells bad jokes
                      And he ropes, and he rides,
                      He lives life fast and loves to fight
                      He's a booser, a looser,
                      He calls me up when he's had too much
                    He's a schemer, a dreamer I tell him to change his ways,
                      But he just turns, to me and says,
                      I (I) ain't (ain't) no quitter
                      Whooooaahh!! I ain't givin' up on him just yet,
                      'Cause I'm as stubborn as a girl can get
                      No he won't quit, but you can bet,
                      Sticking to it , I (I) ain't (ain't),

                      Well he flirts too much and he loves blond chicks
                      And he struts, and he strolls,
                      He looks so cool and yep he knows!
                      He's a beauty, a cutie,
