 You're flyin' loose and I'm losin' ground with you
 Want you to stay cause I can't follow you
 You know I'll wait forever if you want me to
 It's not you talkin', I know it's who you're talkin' to
 C H O R U S:
   Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
   Saw you on Monday with purple hair
   No matter what you do you'll find me there
   Missing you on Sunday, our number one day
   Yeah, I'm missing the answer to my prayers
I see you walkin' through the danger zone
   That's not the way I used to walk you home
   Don't wanna hold you back I'll let you go alone
   And pray that someday you'll come back on your own
C H O R U S:
   Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
   Saw you on Monday with purple hair
   No matter what you do you'll find me there
   Missing you on Sunday, our number one day
 Yeah, I'm missing the answer to my prayers
Some people say I'm such a fool to wait for you
   But I can't close the gates to Heaven we once knew
   Not such a mystery
   Always been clear to me
   When you're around I see
   The sun come shinin' through
C H O R U S:
   Missed you on Sunday cause you weren't there
