 
There was always the voice of an angel
In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
Who would sing me a song made in Heaven
That awakened the music in me
You gave my life such meaning
Shined light upon my soul
And you were always there to hold
When I come to the end of tomorrows
  And I look back on all of my days
  I imagine I'll be there beside you
  And we'll talk in our usual way
  And we will dance
  We will sing
  Still amazed by everything
And we will dance and we will sing
  We're still amazed by everything
  The simple joys that life can bring
  The songs you taught me how to sing and yes
  We will sing them again
  In my heart they'll never end
When I'm lost I pray that I can find you
  When the darkness seems to hide the light
  When I'm up I know I'm flying with you
  All the things I love are all because of you
  Because of you
You were always the one with the courage
  Taught me all that I needed to know
  When I needed a shoulder to cry on
  You would reach out a hand I could hold
  Your strength and all your kindness
  Became a part of me
  And I will always try to be
  I'll be, the me, you hoped I'd always be
S O L O
We will dance
  We will sing
  Still amazed by everything
  And we will dance and we will sing
  We're still amazed by everything
  The simple joys that life can bring
  The songs you taught me how to sing and yes
  We will sing them again
  In my heart they'll never end
In your eyes, I always see my future
  In your smile, I always see the reason for my ways
  In your voice, I know the truth has meaning
  When you sing to me I hear your heart speak to me
There was always the voice of an angel
  In the sweet lullaby of my dreams
  Who would sing me a song made in Heaven
  That awakened the music in me
  The music in me
 When I come to the end of tomorrows
  And I look back on all of my days
  I imagine I'll be there beside you
  And we'll talk in our usual way
  And we will dance
  We will sing
