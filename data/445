 I was born a dreamer, seemed like every day
my mind came up with something new.
But this time it�s my heart, with a dream that�s here to stay.
There�s a chance this one might come true.

I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.
And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.
Two hearts, one love . . . that�s us.

I can see my lucky starts, when I gaze into your eyes.
Twilight�s shadows hold us tenderly.
It�s so easy to imagine, you here by my side
as I turn out the lights and fall to sleep.
I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.

And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.
Two hearts, one love . . . that�s us.
I can see me being with you, for the rest of my life.
Two hearts, one love.
And I can see you loving me too, sure would be nice.

Two hearts, one love . . . that�s us.
Two hearts, one love.
Two hearts, one love . . . that�s us.
