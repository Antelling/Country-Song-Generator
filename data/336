 Well, enough
Of this nonsense, baby
We're bigger than this
Let's get back to us
And the thrill we felt with our first kiss
You know the road can take us
Out where we both feel so alive
Let's go tonight
You can put your lipstick on while I drive
Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
  (While I drive)
Well, I'm tired
  Of this life we're livin'
  Dreamin' dead-end dreams
  Like a worn-out ol' shag carpet frayin' at the seams
  You know we got to change it
  No waitin' 'til the time is right
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)
Bridge:
  Let me touch you
  Let me love you
  Let your heart race next to mine
Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive) Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
  (While I drive) Well, I'm tired
  Of this life we're livin'
  Dreamin' dead-end dreams
  Like a worn-out ol' shag carpet frayin' at the seams
  You know we got to change it
  No waitin' 'til the time is right
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive) Bridge:
  Let me touch you
  Let me love you
  Let your heart race next to mine Chorus:
  We can go down to old El Paso
  Spend the night in New Orleans
  Go out to California like we've always dreamed
  Makin' love out in the desert
  I can watch the sunset in your eyes
  Let's go tonight
  You can put your lipstick on while I drive
  (You can put your lipstick on while I drive)
(While I drive)
