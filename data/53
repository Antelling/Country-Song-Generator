 Well you work and you slave
                      And you spend all day in your thankless job 
                      hen you jump in your Ford 
                      And you're door to door with the homebound mob 
                      Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair 
                      And the one that you love is waiting there And, hey --
                      That's what it's all about
                      Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without 
                      It's a moment frozen there in time 
                      Where the reasons all begin to rhyme 
                      Where love's a little bigger And you finally start figuring out 
                      That's what it's all about Well, they won't go to bed
                      Or do what you said or eat their food
                      They cry and they fuzz and you can't 
                      even cuss 'cause they'll say it, too 
                      You're tired and you're numb 
                      And you're stressed and you're mad 
                      And she smiles and says 'I love you, Dad' And, hey --
                      That's what it's all about
                      Hey, this is the life I couldn't live without It's a moment frozen there in time Where the reasons all begin to rhyme 
                      Where love's a little bigger And you finally start figuring out 
                      That's what it's all about
