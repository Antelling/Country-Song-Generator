 I’ve had love and love’s had me
                      I’ve been held and been set free
                      And I have lived enough to know
                      That you might stay or you might go
                      So here I am one more time
                    Call me brave call me blind I’m gonna count to 3
                      I’m gonna hold my breath
                      Try not to be afraid
                      Tho it scares me half to death
                      I’m out here on a limb
                      Altho I know that it might break
                      My heart is gonna want you anyway
                      And if this love has any chance at all
                      Someone’s gotta be the first to fall The best is just a touch away
                      We’ll make forever day by day
                      It’d be a shame to let this go
                      How sad to think we’d never know
                      How the morning light would fall on us
                      After we make all night in love I’m gonna count to 3
                      I’m gonna hold my breath
                      Try not to be afraid
                      Tho it scares me half to death
                      I’m out here on a limb
                      Altho I know that it might break
                      My heart is gonna want you anyway
                      And if this love has any chance at all
                      Someone’s gotta be the first to fall So here I am one more time
                      Call me brave call me blind I’m gonna count to 3
                      I’m gonna hold my breath
                      Try not to be afraid
                      Tho it scares me half to death
                      I’m out here on a limb
                      Altho I know that it might break
                      My heart is gonna want you anyway
                      And if this love has any chance at all
                      Someone’s gotta be the first to fall
