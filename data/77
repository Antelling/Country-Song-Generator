 How in this world can we put a man on the moon,
                      And still have a need for a place like St Jude's?
                      And why is one man born,
                      In a place where all they know is war?
                      An' a guy like me,
                      Has always been free. An' how can two people who built a lovin' home,
                      Try for years an' never have a child of their own?
                      When somewhere out there tonight,
                      There's a baby no-one's holdin' tight:
                      In need of love.
                      To me, that don't add up. But I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans.
                      I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky.
                      So I don't mean to second guess you,
                      Or criticise what I don't understand.
                      These are just a few questions I have. An' why did my cousin have to die in that crash?
                      A good kid, only seventeen, I still wonder 'bout that.
                      It seems unfair to me,
                      Some get the chance to chase their dreams,
                      An' some don't.
                      But what do I know? I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans.
                      I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky.
                      So I don't mean to second guess you,
                      Or criticise what I don't understand.
                      These are just a few questions I have. Why do I feel like you hear these prayers of mine.
                      When so many oughta be ahead of me in line?
                      When you look down on me,
                      Can you see the good through all the bad?
                      These just a few questions I have.
