 Outside my window, I swear on my mothers grave,
                      Faded out the street noise like a, out of focus polaroid,
                      So we shot the moon, and I cursed the wind,
                      Making me think that you were, here again,
                      Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away,
                      Thats the biggest conspiracy since, JFK,
                      So we combed the corners, and glass houses,
                    We got directions, but, never found it. Well I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
                      Just the mere reflection of your face,
                      For one shining moment... (Chorus:)
                      With you, somebody like you,
                      With you, somebody just like you, We called inspectors, the cops and the CIA,
                      The drooch truck circles round, the places that we used to lay,
                      But nobody testified, not a single witness,
                      Swore i was crucified and, no forgiveness,
                      The sherriff sounded a lot like I was drunk and dangerous,
                      My hands were already tied, so he , put away his handcuffs,
                      And in the blindspot, I saw the silhouette,
                      Of a crazy man smoking , long black cigarette,
                      But I'd trade in all the rest of my days,
                      Your crooked smile, your wicked ways,
                      I'd fill up all this centre space, (Chorus:)
                      With you, somebody like you,
                      With you, somebody just like you,
                      Oh you, somebody like you.. oh Now I shoulda learned my lesson,
                      Done what I was told,
                      Shoulda counted all my blessings,
                      And my fingers and toes,
                      And now I'm, tripping like a blind man,
                      And searching high and low,
                      For you, somebody like you
                      For you, somebody just like you... For you, somebody like you,
                      For you somebody just like you Yeah... yeah somebody just like you
                      Somebody just like you...
