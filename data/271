 How will I ever know what you're feelin'
How will I ever know what to do
If you simply refuse to tell me
What's goin' on inside of you
Have a little faith in me
Baby can't you see
You've got to talk to me
How can I even know how to help you
  How can I ever know what to say
  If every time your heart is hurtin'
  You turn from me and walk away
  Have a little faith in me
  Baby can't you see
  You've got to talk to me
No you don't have to lie
  Look into my eyes
  There's nothin' here but love for you
  You don't have to feel alone
  Let me share the load
  There's nothin' more I'd rather do
I'm the one you can always turn to
  I'm the one who will stand by your side
  My love for you is forever
  You don't ever have to run away and hide
  Have a little faith in me
  Baby can't you see
  You've got to talk to me
 How can I even know how to help you
  How can I ever know what to say
  If every time your heart is hurtin'
  You turn from me and walk away
  Have a little faith in me
  Baby can't you see
  You've got to talk to me No you don't have to lie
  Look into my eyes
  There's nothin' here but love for you
  You don't have to feel alone
  Let me share the load
  There's nothin' more I'd rather do I'm the one you can always turn to
  I'm the one who will stand by your side
  My love for you is forever
  You don't ever have to run away and hide
  Have a little faith in me
  Baby can't you see
  You've got to talk to me
