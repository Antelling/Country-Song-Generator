 Everytime our eyes meet
                      This feeling inside me
                      is almost more than i can take
                      Baby when you touch me
                      I can feel howmuch you love me
                      And it just blows me away
                      I've never been this close to anyone or anything
                      I can hear your thoughts 
                      i can see your dreams  Chorus:
                      I don't know how you do what you do
                      I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better
                      i wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side
                      Forever and ever
                      Every little thing that you do
                      Baby i'm amazed by you The smell of you skin
                      the taste of your kiss
                      the way you whisper in the dark
                      your hair all around me, baby you surround me
                      you touch every place in my heart
                      oh, it feels like the first time everytime
                      i wanna spend the whole night in your eyes Chorus Every little thing that you do
                      i'm so nove with you 
                      it just keeps getting better 
                      I wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side
                      forever and ever
                      Every little thing that you do
                      oh, every little thing that you do
