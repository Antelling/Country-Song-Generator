 
Fast train
Where do your passengers wait?
What's at the heart of your engine's rage?
To what smooth place at the end of the line
  With crackling fires and quiet plains
  Do the trees bend down
  Fold their limbs round you?
  Welcome home faithful one
  We forgive you.
Slow down fast train
  Slow down fast train
  Take me with you
 To what smooth place at the end of the line
  With crackling fires and quiet plains
  Do the trees bend down
  Fold their limbs round you?
  Welcome home faithful one
  We forgive you. Slow down fast train
  Slow down fast train
  Take me with you
