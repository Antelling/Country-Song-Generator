 
                      I met a guy on the red eye
                      He spotted my guitar 
                      and said what do you do?
                      I said, I sing for a living,
                      Country music mixed with 
                      a little rock and a little blues
                      He said I'm sorry 
                      but I've never been crazy 
                      'bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
                      What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
                    I just looked at him and laughed and said cause it's songs about me
                      and who I am
                      songs about loving and living 
                      and good hearted women and family and God
                      yeah they're all just 
                      songs about me
                      songs about me So I offered him tickets
                      I said you'll see what I mean 
                      if you show up tonight
                      he said I doubt you'll change my opinion
                      I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try Then later on when we finished our songs
                      about scars and cars and broken hearts
                      I saw him, he was standing there 
                      right next to the stage 
                      and he shouted
                      man you were right 
                      it was like you sang those songs about me
                      and who I am
                      songs about loving and living 
                      and good hearted women and family and God
                      yeah they're all just 
                      songs about me
                      songs about me So I'll just keep on singing
                      'til I hear the whole world singing those  songs about me
                      and who I am
                      songs about loving and living 
                      and good hearted women and family and God
                      yeah they're all just 
                      songs about me
                      songs about me
