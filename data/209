 Baby lock the door and turn the light down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I’ve been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on 
Just to be your man

There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take out time
Come a little closer
Lets go over 
What i had in mind

Baby lock the door and turn the light down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I’ve been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on 
Just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody 
The way that i love you
We're alone now
You don't how 
Long I’ve wanted to

Lock the door and turn the light down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I’ve been thinking bout this all day long
never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on 
Just to be your man
I Can't believe how much it turns me on 
Just to be your man
