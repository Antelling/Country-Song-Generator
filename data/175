 
Hillbillies love it in the hay 
 Tractors parked out in the yard 
   I say you and me take it down to the barn 
   Pull it inside and climb to the top 
   Spread out a blanket in a favorite spot 
   Pitch that pitchfork out the way 
   Hillbillies love it in the hay 
Grab that bottle of strawberry wine 
   Plate full of chicken and some of that pie 
   We could be there all night long 
   You know how we get when we get it on 
   Up in the loft down yonder way (whatda say?) 
   Hillbillies love it in the hay 
Let me down on a bed of gold 
   Roll me round til the cows come home 
   Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass 
   Hillbillies like it like that 
Sun's comin up and the rooster crows 
   Hound dog chewin on a chicken bone (chicken bone) 
   You and me just havin a ball 
   That's a good thing that old mule can't talk (good guess) 
   Ain't no tellin what he might say 
   Hillbillies love it in the [mule noise] 
HEY! 
Let me down on a bed of gold 
   Roll me round til the cows come home 
   Drive me wild in the soft sweet grass (aww yes) 
   Hillbillies like it like that 
Hey Hillbilly, Hey Hillbilly, 
   Hey Hillbilly, Hey Hillbilly
