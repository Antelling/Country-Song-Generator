 Well it's gettin' late now baby
I really should be gettin' home
If it feels like I've been here to long,
Must be time for me to go
How can we be here together
And still be so alone
If you dont feel the way I do by now
It must be time for me to go
You know I don't really wanna leave
Baby there's no place I'd rather be
Holdin' on but I'm afraid,
But I'm runnin' out of reasons to stay
Well it's gettin' late now baby
And the wind is blowin' cold
If there's nothin' left for us to say
Must be time for me to go
