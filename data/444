 Well grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar,
                      blue collar of a man...
                      He came from the school of
                      "you don't need nothin' if you can't make it with your own two hands"
                      He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
                      no sir, yes ma'am, by god, I'll be darned, hell yeah I'm American..
                      and all the years he walked this earth
                      I swear all he did was work.
                      He said the devil dreams on an idle horse
                    so you listen to me squirt.. Don't get too high on a bottle,
                      and get right with a man.
                      Fight your fights, find your grace
                      and all the things you two can't change, and help somebody if you can Now Granny said sonny
                      stick to your gun if you believe in something
                      no matter what
                      cause it's better to be hated for who you are
                      Than loved for someone you're not.
                      She was 5 feet of concrete
                      New York born and raised on a slick city street.
                      She'll stare you down, stand her ground,
                      still kickin' and screamin' at 93
                      I remember how frail she looked
                      in that hospital bed
                      taking her last few breaths of life
                      and smiling as she said Don't get too high on a bottle,
                      just a little syrup now and then,
                      fight your fights,
                      find your grace,
                      and all the things you two can't change
                      and help somebody if you can,
                      and get right with a man I never let a cowboy make the coffee
                      yeah thats what Granny always said to my Grandad
                      and he'd say never tell a joke
                      that ain't that funny more than once
                      and if you wanna hear God laugh,
                      tell Him your plans Don't get too high on a bottle,
                      get right with a man, son.
                      fight your fights,
                      find your grace,
                      and all the things you two can't change
                      and help somebody if you can
                      and get right with a man and get right with a man
