 Woke up this mourning
                      With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
                      like a weight that I've carried
                    Has been carried away, away But I know something is coming 
                      I don't know what it is
                      But I know it's amazing, you same me
                      My time is coming
                      And I'll find a way out of this life... It feels like today I know it feels like today I'm sure
                      It's the one thing that's missin'
                      The one thing I'm wishin'
                      Life's sacred blessin'
                      It feels like today
                      Feels like today You treat life like a picture
                      But it's not a moment frozen in time
                      It's not gonna wait
                      Til you make up your mind, at all So while this storm is breaking
                      While there's light at the end of the tunnel
                      Keep running towards it
                      Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
                      Soon this daw will break And it feels like today
                      I know, it feels like today, I'm sure
                      It's the one thing that's missin'
                      The one thing you're wishin'
                      Life's sacred blessin'
                      It feels like today Feels like, feels like your life changes
                      Feels like, feels like your life changes It's the one thing that's missin'
                      The one thing you're wishin'
                      Life's sacred blessin'
                      It feels like today Feels like, feels like your life changes
                      Feels like, feels like your life change
