 Buddy you and me go way back 
                      Camp all June, all through highschool and before that. 
                      So I don't mind tellin you I'm scared to death. 
                      The doctor is goin in on the 25th 
                      It's the same thing my daddy had 
                    Thank God they caught it fast.  But if something should happen 
                      Stop in some time and say hello to Catherine 
                      You and Marianne could always keep her laughing 
                      Because shes gonna need a lot of that 
                      Take her out to a movie 
                      It's gonna take sometime before shes back on her feet. 
                      I know you think I'll be fine and I'm talkin crazy 
                      But theres always that chance 
                      That's why I'm askin 
                      If something should happen  Little Nathan is growing up so fast 
                      This November he'll turn 10 
                      He wants to play quarterback. 
                      I'm supposed to coach his team this fall 
                      But I may not get to afterall 
                      He's gonna need someone to catch a pass 
                      And to throw it back  If something should happen 
                      Oh promise me you'll take that boy out campin 
                      Throw a line out in the water every now and then 
                      Answer and questions that he has 
                      Maybe once he gets older 
                      You can sit and have that first cold beer together 
                      And tell him a couple stories on his father 
                      He's always known your my best friend. 
                      That's why I'm askin 
                      If something should happen  I hope I live until I'm 80 
                      And I get to see my son get married 
                      And have some babies 
                      And make a million more memories with my wife. 
                      Yeah buddy I pray alright 
                      But if it's my time to leave 
                      Could you watch over them for me?  If something should happen
                    If something should happen
                    If something should happen
                    If something should happen
                    If something should happen
                    If something should happen
