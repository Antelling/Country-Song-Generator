 Well I'm an eight ball shooting double fisted 
                      Drinking son of a gun 
                      I wear my jeans a little tight 
                      Just to watch the little boys come undone
                      I'm here for the beer and the ball busting band gona get a little crazy just because i can 
                      (Chorus)
                      You know im here for the party 
                      And i aint leaving till they throw me out gonna have a little fun gonna get me some 
                    You know im here, im here for the party I may not be a ten but the boys say i clean up good 
                      And if i gave em half a chance 
                      For some rowdy romance you know they would 
                      I've been waiting all week just to have a good time 
                      So bring on them cowboys and their pick up lines  (Chorus)
                      You know im here for the party 
                      And i aint leaving till they throw me out gonna have a little fun gonna get me some 
                      You know im here, im here for the party Dont want no purple hooter shooter just some 
                      Jack on the rocks
