 
I guess he's working late again
 I don't need to wonder where he is
 But I do
 He oughta know that by now
 I know his work takes a lot of him
   There's not much left for him to give
   But I need more
   He oughta know that by now
It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
   It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around
   He oughta know that by now
He used to promise soon things would change
   It's been years and it's still the same
   And that hurts
   He oughta know that by now
I've grown so used to being alone
   Couldn't be much worse if I were gone
   And in a way I am
   He oughta know that by now
It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
   It's just too hard to hold on to what is never around
   He oughta know that by now
Heart ache and coffee at midnight motels
   Leaving him was hard as hell
   But I did
   And he oughta know that by now
I didn't try to explain
   No goodbye underneath my ring
   That was all I left
   He oughta know that by now
   That was all I left
   And he oughta know that by now
 I know his work takes a lot of him
   There's not much left for him to give
   But I need more
   He oughta know that by now It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
   It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around

   It's been years and it's still the same
   And that hurts
