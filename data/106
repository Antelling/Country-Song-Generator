 From the hills of Kaycee, Wyoming
                      Where life's wooly and wild
                      There's a Navy brat in a cowboy hat
                      And that Copenhagen smile
                      And from buckin' broncs to honky tonks
                      He always sang a cowboy's song
                      We were much too young, havin' too much fun
                    As we all sang along We sang Life's a Highway
                      There's only one way you're gonna get through it
                      When she starts to twist be more like Chris
                      Pull your hat down tight
                      And just LeDoux it!
                      When that whistle blows
                      And that crowd explodes
                      And them pickup men are at your side
                      They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride From gold buckles to gold records
                      Once again he was spinnin' 'round
                      Took the whole world on
                      And he turned us on to that Western Underground
                      And from Bareback Jack to This Cowboy's Hat
                      The songs were stronger than his pain
                      He would not slow down from town to town
                      Like children running thru the rain We sang Life's a Highway
                      There's only one way you're gonna get through it
                      When she starts to twist be more like Chris
                      Pull your hat down tight
                      And just LeDoux it!
                      When that whistle blows
                      And that crowd explodes
                      And them pickup men are at your side
                      They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride We sang Life's a Highway
                      There's only one way you're gonna get through it
                      When she starts to twist be more like Chris
                      Pull your hat down tight
                      And just LeDoux it!
                      When that whistle blows
                      And that crowd explodes
                      And them pickup men are at your side
                      They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride When we cross that river Jordan,
                      With St Peter on the other side
                      Singin' Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride!
                      Say Good Ride Cowboy, Good Ride!
