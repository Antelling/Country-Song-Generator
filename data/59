 A misty sunrise in my hometown,
                      Rows of cotton 'bout knee high.
                      Mrs. Baker down the dirt road,
                      Still got clothes out on the line.
                      Irwin Nichols, there with Judsley,
                      Playin' Chequers at the gin.
                      When I dream about the Southland,
                    This is where it all begins. From Carolina down to Georgia,
                      Smell the Jasmine and Magnolia.
                      Sleepy sweet home, Alabama, 
                      Roll Tide Roll.
                      Muddy water, Mississippi,
                      Blessed Graceland whispers to me.
                      Carry on, carry on:
                      Sweet southern comfort, carry on. Catchin' catfish on the river;
                      Chasin' fireflies by the creek.
                      Kissin' Gary Williams' sister,
                      On the porch, homecoming week.
                      With rusted cars and weepin' willows,
                      Keepin' watch out in the yard.
                      Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie,
                      Could be anywhere you are, In Carolina or in Georgia,
                      Open arms are waitin' for you.
                      Louisiana, Yellow Rose of,
                      San Antone.
                      Arkansas, Mississippi, 
                      Old man river whispers to me: 
                      Carry on, carry on:
                      Sweet southern comfort, carry on. Instrumental break. As I sit here I'm surrounded,
                      By these priceless memories.
                      I don't have to think about it:
                      Theres no place I'd rather be. Than Carolina or in Georgia,
                      Smell the Jasmine and Magnolia.
                      Sleepy sweet home, Alabama, 
                      Roll Tide Roll.
                      Muddy water, Mississippi,
                      Blessed Graceland whispers to me.
                      Carry on, carry on:
                      Sweet southern comfort,
                      Carry on, carry on:
                      Sweet southern comfort, carry on.
