 Single six months yesterday
                      Thought I oughta celebrate
                    So I went down to grab a couple beers And I got so drunk I ripped my pants
                      I asked the bouncer for a dance
                      I thanked him as he threw me out
                      I woke up at a Waffle House
                      With a shiner and a wild brunette
                      She don’t know my real name yet
                      Well no I ain’t over you But I’m doin’ my best
                      Every day and every night
                      Hangin’ on by a thread
                      That’s stretched just a little too tight
                      If I can’t find some peace of mind
                      I’ll take what I can get
                      I ain’t doin’ much good
                      But I’m doin’ my best I decided I’d get smart
                      And have a long talk with my heart
                      At some quiet spot outside of town So I took my best friend’s Pontiac
                      I drove it like a maniac
                      Right into the reservoir
                      I guess we ain’t best friends no more
                      Just my luck a cop came by
                      Who I beat up in junior high
                      He said I better have a good excuse I said I’m doin’ my best
                      Every day and every night
                      Hangin’ on by a thread
                      That’s stretched just a little too tight
                      If I can’t find some peace of mind
                      I’ll take what I can get
                      I ain’t doin’ much good
                      But I’m doin’ my best Some day I just might join the human race again
                      If I can ever find a place to show my face again
                      Yeah I'm doin' my best I said I’m doin’ my best
                      Every day and every night
                      Hangin’ on by a thread
                      That’s stretched just a little too tight
                      If I can’t find some peace of mind
                      I’ll take what I can get
                      I ain’t doin’ much good
                      But I’m doin’ my best
                      I'm doin' my best
                      I'm doin' my best
