 I've got some big news, the bank fin'lly came through,
                      An' I'm holdin' the keys to my brand new Chevrolet.
                      Have you been outside? It sure is a nice night.
                      How about a little test drive down by the lake?
                      There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out.
                      We can try out the four-wheel drive.
                      C'mon now, whaddya say?
                    Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.  'Cause it's a good night to be out there soakin' up the moonlight.
  Stake out a little piece of shoreline.
  I've got the perfect place in mind.
  It's in the middle of no-where.
  Only one way to get there.
  You gotta get a little mud on the tires. Moonlight on a duck blind, catfish on a trout line;
                      Sun sets about nine at this time of year.
                      We can throw a blanket down, crickets singin' in the background,
                      An' more stars than you can count on a night this clear.
                      I tell you, what we need to do is grab a sleepin' bag or two,
                      An' build us a little camp fire.
                      An' then with a little luck, we might just get stuck.
                      Let's get a little mud on the tires.  'Cause it's a good night to be out there soakin' up the moonlight.
