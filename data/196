 He wore that cowboy hat
                      To cover up his horns
                      Sweet talkin' forked tongue
                      Had a tempting charm
                      Before I turned around
                      That girl was gone
                      All I can say is 
                      Bartender pour me something strong chorus:
                      Here's to the past
                      They can kiss my glass
                      I hope she's happy with him
                      Here's to the girl
                      Who wrecked my world
                      That angel that did me in
                      I think the devil 
                      Drives a Coup de Ville
                      I watched him drive away over the hill
                      Not against her will
                      And I've got time to kill
                      Down in Brokenheartsville It was long and chrome
                      Sittin' in the lot
                      Fire engine red
                      That thing was hot
                      He revved it up
                      She waved goodbye
                      Love's gone to hell
                      And so have I Chorus(2 times)
