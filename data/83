                    But I already been on the CMA's,
                    Hell Tim McGraw said he liked the change,
                    That he likes the way my Hick-hop sounds and the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground,

                    My voice I your choice that you wanted to hear,
                    So the boys make the noise when the buffalo roams,
                    Blast into me bones that you might have known.

                    With a big belt buckle,
                    The Cowboy Dorado,
                    All over the World Wide Web you'll see that low CDP on that MP3,
                    Speak clearly what I say so you comprehend in the name of Hick-hop radio tuned in,
                    Roaming like thunder on the scene,
                    It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean.
                    I never claimed to be the hardest of the hard rock brothers,
                    But I'm booming at the box,
                    Skills got you jumping out your socks.
                    From Texas here I come movin' your body with the base kick drum. [Instrumental] [Chorus - Big & Rich]
