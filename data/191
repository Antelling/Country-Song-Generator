 Baby when I look at you,
                      You know it breaks my heart in two,
                      How beautiful you are (verse 2)
                      Seen you in a million dreams,
                      now you're finally here with me,
                      We will never be apart (bridge)
                      I wanna hold you forever,
                      That's all I'll ever need (chorus)
                      You are my love, you are my life,
                      My heart and soul the truest friend I've ever known,
                      You are my world, all of my dreams,

                      Everytime I close my eyes,
                      Hit's me so deep inside,
                      How ill this feelin is, I'm intoxicated by your touch,
                      It's a sweet sweet rush,
                      I'm in love with your kiss, (bridge)
                      You're the one that I trust the most,
