 Day One 
                      I stumbled through hello on 5th avenue
                      Day Two
                      We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
                      Caught a movie on day Fourteen
                      And day sixty-seven she said I love you to me Chorus:
                      Oh what a feeling
                      What a wonderful emotion
                      Yeah what a life
                      Counting my blessings and knowing....
                      Ooh we had our ups and downs
                      All along the way
                      She had a chance to leave but chose to stay What a beautiful day (x2) Day One Sixteen
                      I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
                      Day One Eighty Nine
                      Oh I almost lost that girl to my Foolish pride
                      But she said I do on day Four Eighty Two
                      and gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One Chorus What a beautiful Day Day Eighteen Thousand Two hundred and Fifty Three
