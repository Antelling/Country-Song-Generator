 Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
                      Ever knocked on the sky 
                      and had it fall on your head
                      well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
                      Ever lost your luggage, your marbles, 
                      your house
                      Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
                      Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
                      Or caught in morning traffic when you 
                    really gotta go - Oh no!  [Chorus]
                      Life is funny, life's a mess
                      Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
                      Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
                      Life gets sticky, life can bruise
                      Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
                      No matter what it brings
                      Don't worry 'bout a thing Ever sat yourself down when the 
                      seat is all wet
                      Or see your "ex" sucking face with 
                      a little brunette
                      Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
                      Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
                      best friend
                      Or found your last record in the bargain bin
                      Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
                      Or scraped someone else's gum off the 
                      bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo! [Repeat Chorus]
                      Life is funny, life's a mess
                      Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
                      Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
                      Life gets sticky, life can bruise
                      Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
                      No matter what it brings
                    Don't worry 'bout a thing                     (Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah,
                      Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, 
                      Blah) Don't worry, don't worry [Bridge:]
                      We all got a little junk in the trunk
                      And when you're feelin' good as sunk
                      Remember, everything will be just fine
                      If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine [Repeat Chorus 2x]
                      Life is funny, life's a mess
                      Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
                      Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
                      Life gets sticky, life can bruise
                      Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
                      No matter what it brings
                    Don't worry 'bout a thing                     (Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah,
                      Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, 
                      Blah) Don't worry, don't worry Life gets sticky, life can bruise
                      Sometimes you win sometimes your losing
                      No matter what it brings
                      Don't worry 'bout a thing (thank you very much)
