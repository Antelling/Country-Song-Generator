 Trying to keep a candle burning in a hurricane,
                      That’s what it’s like when you love me and you leave me this way,
                      Like a dove crying out when he’s lost the will to fly,
                      Yeah, shackled down to the earth by your long chain of lies,
                    Well, I’ll forgive you tomorrow if the sun doesn’t shine,
                      Let you back into my life when the oceans are dry,
                      Take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray,
                      But I just can’t do it today,
                      I can’t do it today, Well I can see you dancing in that strangers arms,
                      My world hasn’t stopped turning but it’s falling apart,
                      Every breath that I take’s a little closer to sane,
                      Yeah, they say that time is a healer but it’s still a long, long ways a way
                      Yeah, I’ll forgive you tomorrow if the sun doesn’t shine,
                      Let you back into my life when the oceans are dry,
                      Take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray,
                      But I just can’t do it today,
                      I can’t do it today, Don’t wanna do it today,
                      Well there’s a part of me that wishes I could just forget,
                      But I haven’t found the mercy yet, 
                      Ain’t no mercy yet, I’ll forgive you tomorrow if the sun doesn’t shine,
                      Let you back into my life when the oceans are dry,
                      Take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray,
                      But I just can’t do it today,
                      I can’t do it today, I just can’t do it today,
                      I just can’t do it today,
                      Don’t wanna do it today,
                      Can’t do it today,
                      Not gonna do it today
