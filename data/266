 Hey Mona Lisa, who was Leonardo?
Was he Andy Warhol?
You were Marilyn Monroe
Hey Mozart, what kind of name is Amadeus
It?s kinda like Elvis
You gotta die to be famous
I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me
I?ll probably never hold a brush
  that paints a masterpeice
  Probably never find a pen
  that writes a symphony
  But if I will love then I will find
  That I have touched another life
  And that?s something
  Something worth leaving behind
Hey Midas you say you have the magic touch
  That even all that shiny stuff
  Someday is gonna turn to dust
  Hey Jesus it must have been some Sunday morning
  In a blaze of glory
  We?re still tellin? your story
  I may not go down in history
  I just want someone to remember me
I?ll probably never dream a dream
  and watch it turn to gold
  No, I?ll never lose my life
  to save another soul
  If I will love then I will find
  That I have touched another life
  And that?s something
  Something worth leaving behind
Hey baby see the future that we?re building
  Our love lives on in the lives of our children
  And that?s something
  Something worth leaving behind
 I?ll probably never hold a brush
  that paints a masterpeice
  Probably never find a pen
  that writes a symphony
  But if I will love then I will find
  That I have touched another life
  And that?s something
