 Tell me what I have to do tonight,
                      ‘Cause I’d do anything to make it right.
                      Let’s be us again.
                      Sorry for the way I lost my head,
                      I don’t know why I said the things I said:
                    Let’s be us again.  Here I stand with everything to lose,
                      And all I know is, I don’t wanna ever see the end.
                      Baby, please, I’m reaching out for you,
                      Won’t you open up your heart an' let me come back in?
                      Let’s be us again,
                      Ooh, us again.  Look at me, I’m way past pride.
                      Isn’t there some way that we can try,
                      To be us again.
                      An' even if it takes a while,
                      I’ll wait right here until I see that smile,
                      That says we’re us again.  Here I stand with everything to lose,
                      And all I know is, I don’t wanna ever see the end.
                      Baby, please, I’m reaching out for you,
                      Won’t you open up your heart an' let me come back in?
                      Let’s be us.  Instrumental break.  Baby, baby, what would I do?
                      Can’t imagine life without you.  Here I stand with everything to lose,
                      And all I know is, I don’t wanna ever see the end.
                      Baby, please, I’m reaching out for you,
                      Won’t you open up your heart an' let me come back in?
                      Oh, here I am, I’m reaching out for you,
                      So won’t you open up your heart an' let me come back in?
                      Let’s be us again.
                      Oh, let’s be us again.
