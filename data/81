 Next to Lousiana on the Texas side,
                    There's a little country joint where they let it ride.
                    There's a boogie woogie man on the piano,
                    An' all the backwoods boppers shoutin': "Go cat, go." They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
                    Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
                    So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
                    He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
                    So don't you,
                    Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man. Grandpa's in the corner in his fishing clothes,
                    Reelin' to the rhythm everywhere it goes.
                    All the boogie woogie babies tearing up the floor.
                    When they get a little bit, they want a little more. They've never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
                    Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
                    So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
                    He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
                    So don't you,
                    Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man. Instrumental break. In a red El Dorado, at the break of day,
                    That Boogie Woogie man'll be slipping away.
                    Although you're never gonna know it when he's out of sight,
                    He'll shut a juke box down again tomorrow night. He's never been afraid of the Boogie Man.
                    Nothin' makes you feel better than the boogie woogie can.
                    So don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man:
                    He'll take you down to New Orleans where that rhythm all began.
                    It works for me, it'll work for you,
                    He'll have you doin' things that you didn't know you knew.
                    So don't you,
                    Don't you be afraid.
                    No, don't ya,
                    Don't you be afraid of the Boogie Man, no.
