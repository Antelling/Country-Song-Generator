 
For a straight-A student who knows so much
 You don't know nothin' 'bout love
 You and me make history
 There's no two hearts like us
 Well go on pretend
 You can't figure it out
 Well if there's any doubt
 C H O R U S:
   Let me spell it out for you, honey
   You don't want to miss
   The perfect combination of
   Three words, two hearts, one kiss
   Three words, two hearts, one kiss
I know where I'm supposed to be
   A heart beats right on time
   I don't know why you're holdin' back
   When you're the first in line
   We better catch this train
   Waitin' on the tracks
   Cause it might not come back
Let me spell it out for you, honey
   You don't want to miss
   The perfect combination of
   Three words, two hearts, one kiss, oh!
S O L O
   Three words that say I love you
   Two hearts that beat as one, oh
Let me spell it out for you, honey
   You don't want to miss
   The perfect combination of
   Three words, two hearts, one kiss
   The perfect combination of
   Three words, two hearts, one kiss - ooh yeah
