 

Well, he told me I had what it takes,
And he told me all I needed was one lucky break.
Then he played me like he played his guitar,
And he said, "When you get to Nashville,
I'll make you a star."
Chorus:
  But I never got to Nashville
  He didn't make me a star.
  No, I never got to Nashville,
  I'm still playing in this bar.
  But I'm going to keep on trying,
  'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
  Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
  Someday I'll get that lucky break.
The jukebox plays his records, he's number one.
  And now I know that I was just one night of fun.
  Time goes by and Nashville seems so far away.
  But, I know that I can make it, I'm on my way.
Chorus:
  But I never got to Nashville
  He didn't make me a star.
  No, I never got to Nashville,
  I'm still playing in this bar.
  But I'm going to keep on trying,
  'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
  Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
Someday I'll get that lucky break.

 Chorus:
  But I never got to Nashville
  He didn't make me a star.
  No, I never got to Nashville,
  I'm still playing in this bar.
  But I'm going to keep on trying,
  'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
  Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
  Someday I'll get that lucky break. The jukebox plays his records, he's number one.
  And now I know that I was just one night of fun.
  Time goes by and Nashville seems so far away.
  But, I know that I can make it, I'm on my way. Chorus:
  But I never got to Nashville
  He didn't make me a star.
  No, I never got to Nashville,
  I'm still playing in this bar.
  But I'm going to keep on trying,
  'Cause trying hard is what it takes.
  Some day I'll be big in Nashville.
Someday I'll get that lucky break.
