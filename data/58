 
If she were any other woman
I wouldnt going home right now
Id stay out a little while longer
Put another coat of paint on this town
Is she was any other woman
  Id go home just to keep the peace
  But Ive found shes where I find it
  So thats where I want to be
If she was any other woman
  She wouldnt have this hold on me
  Ain't no woman like my woman
  So there ain't no other man I'd rather be
If she were any other woman
  Lord knows she might of thought twice
  Bout hanging all her dreams on a dreamer
  Cause it aint' been any easy ride
IF she were any other woman
  No tellin where I'd be right now
  She keeps my head from turning
  And my feet on solid ground
If she were any other woman
  She wouldnt have this hold on me
  Ain't no woman like my woman
  So there ain't no other man I'd rather be
She wouldn't stay on my mind
  Mornin noon and night
  She wouldnt move me like she does
If she were any other woman
  She wouldn't have this hold on me
  Ain't no woman like my woman
  So there ain't no other man I'd rather be
Ain't no woman like my woman
  So there ain't no other man I'd rather be

 Is she was any other woman
  Id go home just to keep the peace
  But Ive found shes where I find it
  So thats where I want to be If she was any other woman
