 Mmmm, yeah, yeah. 
                  I been tryin' for a long time, 
                    To find the combination to your heart. 
                    I been a true friend, I let you in every part of me. 
                    Still there you are sayin' you don't know, 
                    If I'm someone you can believe. 
                    So what is it, baby, you can't chance? 
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you? 
                    Can't you tell by the way that you make me move? 
                    I'm all caught up with the things you do. 
                    Please believe me: what else can I do? 
                    Can't you tell I love you? 
                    Yeah. 
It's like you, you you don't feel it's a big deal, 
                    For me to put my heart and soul on the line. 
                    I got news, it's for me an' for you: yeah, I might be crazy. 
                    I don't believe you'll find anybody else, 
                    Who will give you as much as me. 
                    Stop your second guessing girl, what's it gonna be? 
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you? 
                    Can't you tell by the way that you make me move?

Instrumental break. 
When you hold me; when you kiss me; 
                    When you whisper my name in the night. 
                    When you say you can't resist me, 
                    What's left to analyse? 
Can't you tell by the way that I'm touchin' you?
