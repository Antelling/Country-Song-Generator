 Floorboard's filled with baby toys, 
An' empty coke bottles an' coffee cups. 
Drivin' through the rain with no radio, 
Tryin' not to wake her up. 
Cell 'phone says "low battery", 
God, what if I break down? 
I'm just lookin' for an exit with a lotta lights, 
A safe little interstate town.
Just a cheap hotel, 
  With a single bed, 
  And cable TV 
  Is good enough for me an' Emily. 
Some day, when she's old enough, 
  She's gonna start askin' questions about him. 
  Some kid at school brings his Dad for show an' tell, 
  An' gets her little mind a-wonderin' 
"Where's my Daddy? Do I have one? 
"Does he not love me like you do?" 
  Oh, maybe I'll find someone to love the both of us, 
  An' I'll tell her when she's old enough to know the truth. 
Will it break her heart? 
  Will she understand, 
  That I had to leave? 
  That's what was best for me an' Emily. 
That house was never clean enough
  his dinner never warm enough. 
  Nothing I did was ever good enough to make him happy. 
  So, I guess, he gave me what he thought I deserved, 
  But it would kill me if he ever raised his hand to her. 
Big rigs are throwin' rain on my windshield, 
  An' I feel like they're laughin' at me. 
  Fin'lly the storm is lettin' up, 
  An' the mornin' is breakin' free. 
It's a brand new day, 
  It's a second chance. 
  Yesterday is just a memory, 
  For me an' Emily. 
  Ah. 
Floorboard is filled with baby toys, 
  An' empty coke bottles an' coffee cups. 
  Least there's one good thing that he gave me, 
  An' she's startin' to wake up. Just a cheap hotel,
