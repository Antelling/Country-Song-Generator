 Desperation’s causing me,
                      To question every single word you say,
                      The distance that keeps growing in between us,
                      Girl just leaves me so afraid,
                      Well you tried so hard to carry on,
                      But I can tell there’s something wrong these days,
                      Well girl I’ve got to know the truth,
                      Just give it to me straight,
                    Don’t’ look away, Don’t look away,
                      Don’t look away,
                      When I ask you if you love me still, 
                      And if your gonna stay,
                      Don’t look away, Well I’ve known you long enough to know,
                      You’re trying not to let your feelings show,
                      Lately when I hold you near,
                      I still feel I’m sitting hear alone,
                      This confusion setting in your mind,
                      Blocking all the words you mean to say,
                      Well girl I’ve got to know the truth,
                      Just give it to me straight,
