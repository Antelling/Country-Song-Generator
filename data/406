 My grandmother owned a night club
                      On the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
                      Mama put me on a Greyhound
                      And I went to stay with her in the summertime
                      I'd box up those empty long-necks
                      And stack 'em in the back and make a ham
                      Then at night she'd let me sneak out
                    Of the kitchen and let me sit in with the band Yes, I have sacks and quarterbacks
                      And broke my share of bones along the way
                      I knew it wouldn't last forever
                      Semi-pro always means semi-payed
                      I started climbing drilling rigs
                      I'm oil field trash and proud as I can be, yeah
                      Then I took my songs and guitar
                      And sang 'em for a man from Tennessee I've played every beer joint tavern
                      From New York City out to Pasadena
                      Every corn dog fair and rodeo
                      And sold out every basketball arena
                      Like to get down with my boys
                      In Afghanistan and Baghdad City too
                      I am a red, white and blue blood
                      Graduate of Honky Tonk U A star can't burn forever
                      And the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
                      But the glass won't ever be
                      Half empty in my optimistic mind
                      I'll still have a song to sing
                      And a band to turn it up and play it loud
                      As long as there's a bar room
                      With a corner stage and a honky tonk crowd I've played every beer joint tavern
                      From New York City out to Pasadena
                      Every corn dog fair and rodeo
                      And sold out every basketball arena
                      I like to get down with my boys
                      In Afghanistan and Baghdad City too
                      Son, I'm a red, white and blue blood
