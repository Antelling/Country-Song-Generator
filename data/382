 He said goodbye from the edge of the porch
                      like she'd been some casual friend
                      he said "your better off with out me
                      i'm not what you need"
                      like her momma had said about him
                      he started the car
                      pulled out of the drive
                      didn't waste any time lookin' back
                      she watched him go
                      thinkin' even a stranger 
                    would show more compassion than that she could've cried but she didn't have time
                      she had a baby to feed
                      a pink blanket to find
                      to rock their little one to sleep
                      she could've laid in bed for hours
                      giving misery the power
                      but she didn't have time she got a sitter, she got a job
                      'cause she had a promise to keep
                      her day was a factory and evening survival
                      at night was exhaustion and sleep
                      sometimes she felt life was passing her by
                      and watching was all she could do
                      her friends said "you gotta get outta the house
                      and maybe you'll meet someone new" she could've tried
                      but she didn't have time
                      she had a five year old to feed
                      she had ballet class, piano lessons
                      and t-ball little league
                      she could've laid awake for hours
                      giving lonely nights the power
                      but she didn't have the time not time where would she find the time
                      to trust a man again
                      not time for that flat tire
                      a crowded parking lot and then
                      not time to just have coffee with the man
                      who got her tired fixed
                      she was thinking gosh he's handsome
                      when he asked do you have kids she could've lied 
                      but she didnt have time
                      all she said was "she's five"
                      he said "i saw the car seat I love kids
                      does she have your eyes?"
                      and they sat and talked for hours
                      giving destiny it's power
                      she could've been afraid 
                      to fall in love that night
                      but she didn't have time she could've been afraid
                      to fall in love that night
                      but she didn't have time
