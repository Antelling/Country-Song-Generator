 Intro: Verse 1
                      Here we are, what is left of a husband and a wife
                      With four good kids who have a way of getting on with their 
                      lives
                      It's too late to keep from going crazy
                      I've got to get away Chorus
                      The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
                      I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
                      And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
                      I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time Verse 2
                      Our boys are strong now, the spitting image of you when 
                      you were young
                      I hope someday they can see past what you have become
                      And I remember every time I said I'd never leave
                      But what I can't live with is memories of the way you used 
                      to be Chorus
                      The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
                      I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
                      And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
                      I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time Verse 3
                      Twenty years have came and went since I walked out of your 
                      door
                      I never quite made it back to the one I was before
                      And god it hurts me to think of you for the light in your 
                      eyes was gone
                      And sometimes I don't know why this old world can't leave 
                      well enough alone Chorus
                      The reasons I can't stay don't have a thing to do with being 
                      in love
                      I understand that loving a man shouldn't have to be this 
                      rough
                      And you ain't the only one who feels like this world's left 
                      you far behind
                      I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
                      I don't know why you gotta be angry all the time
