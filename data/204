 
It's two a.m., and the 'phone begins to ring.
And if it's her, don't what I'm gonna do.
I'm scared like hell: don't what I'm gonna say.
But I guess I never did, anyway,
An' I thought she would always stay.
Shame on me, for takin' you for granted.
  Shame on me, for all those times I wasn't there.
  Shame on me, for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
  An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
  Shame on me.
Too many times, I put you behind.
  An' couldn't see but girl, you opened up my eyes, yes you did.
  Bein' alone ain't no place I wanna be.
  And I know I should have held you,
  All those times that you asked me to.
Shame on me for takin' you for granted.
  Shame on me for all those times I wasn't there.
  Shame on me for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
  An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
  Shame on me.
Shame on me for takin' you for granted.
  Shame on me for all those times I wasn't there.
  Shame on me for never givin' you all you wanted, yeah, yeah.
  An' acting like sometimes I don't care:
  Shame on me.
  Girl, shame on me.
  Oooh.
