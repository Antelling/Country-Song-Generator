 How can we know how far
                    The long way can be
                    Looking from where we are
                    It never seemed that long to me
                    I've many miles behind me
                    Maybe not so much ahead
                    Seems I made good time
                    With the directions I misread I'm gonna spend my time
                    Like it's going out of style
                    I'm moving the bottom line
                    Farther than a country mile
                    I still have hills to climb
                    Before I hit that wall
                    No matter how much time I buy
                    I can never spend it all Funny thing that time
                    We're always running out
                    I'm always losing mine
                    There's not enough of it about
                    And though it's always here
                    It will always come and go
                    The days become the years
                    That'll be gone before you know So I'm gonna spend my time
                    Like it's going out of style
                    I'm moving the bottom line
                    Better than a country mile
                    I still have hills to climb
                    Before I hit that wall I won't go quietly into that dark night
                    There'll be no more burning daylight
                    I'll be living in
                    Every moment that I'm in I'm gonna spend my time
                    Like it's going out of style
                    I'll only use what's mine
                    I've been saving for a while
                    I still have hills to climb
                    Before I hit that wall
                    No matter how much time I buy
                    I can never spend it all
                    No matter how much time we buy
                    We can never spend it all
