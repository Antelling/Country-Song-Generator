 
This might come as quite a shock
But I’ve given it a lot of thought
This thing that’s come between us can’t be ignored
I’ve taken all I can
And this is where it’s gotta end
I can’t be your friend anymore
And I can’t be accused
  Of not being there for you
  How many nights have you shown up at my door
  I hope you understand
  That this wasn’t in my plans
  But I can’t be your friend anymore
And it’s killing me to know you
  Without having a chance to hold you
  And all I want to do is show you
  How I really feel inside
  You can run to me, you can laugh at me
  Or you can walk right out that door
  But I can’t be your friend anymore
So baby now it’s up to you
  Do I win or do I loose
  Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor
  Well, take me as I am
  Cuz I wanna be your man
  But I can’t be your friend anymore
And it’s killing me to know you
  Without having a chance to hold you
  And all I want to do is show you
  How I really feel inside
  You can run to me, you can laugh at me
  Or you can walk right out that door
  But I can’t just be friends anymore
We can’t be just friends, anymore

 And I can’t be accused
  Of not being there for you
  How many nights have you shown up at my door
  I hope you understand
  That this wasn’t in my plans
  But I can’t be your friend anymore And it’s killing me to know you
  Without having a chance to hold you
  And all I want to do is show you
  How I really feel inside
  You can run to me, you can laugh at me
  Or you can walk right out that door
  But I can’t be your friend anymore So baby now it’s up to you
  Do I win or do I loose
  Will my heart fly or lie broken on the floor
  Well, take me as I am
  Cuz I wanna be your man
  But I can’t be your friend anymore And it’s killing me to know you
  Without having a chance to hold you
  And all I want to do is show you
  How I really feel inside
  You can run to me, you can laugh at me
  Or you can walk right out that door
  But I can’t just be friends anymore We can’t be just friends, anymore
