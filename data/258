 This morning is Monday, where are you now
Teasing my memory, teaching me how to lay low
When I don�t want to
Your love is elusive, this I know now
  It�s makin� me crazy, leaving me out in the open
  When I don�t want to
Baby, I can�t go through this again
  I don�t need to go down, more than I�ve already been
  Just like a wildfire, you�re running all over town
  As much as you burn me baby
  I should be ashes by now
The moments of pleasure just never do last
  They�re gone like a suitcase full of your past
  Long gone and in a hurry
Baby, I can�t go through this again
  I don�t need to go down, more than I�ve already been
  Just like a wildfire, you�re running all over town
  As much as you burn me baby
  I should be ashes by now
