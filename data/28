 
I could feel you reaching out for me
 Before we ever touched
 And I knew you would always be
 Someone I could trust
 I felt your presence through the good times and the bad
 You kept the faith
 You always have
 C H O R U S
   When you saw me getting nowhere
   Trying to find a new direction
   For a stubborn little voice that said I didn't have a prayer
   When my star began to fade
   And I found the stage was bare
   I looked into the wings and you were there
I felt like I was falling
   Going over the edge
   And in this new altitude
   I couldn't catch my breath
   I turned my face to Heaven and it was then I realized
   My guardian angel
   Was here by my side
C H O R U S
   When you saw me getting nowhere
   Trying to find a new direction
   For a stubborn little voice that said I didn't have a prayer
   When my star began to fade
   And I found the stage was bare
 I looked into the wings and you were there
Bridge:
   This song belongs to you
   And you know every word is true
   God only knows were I would be without you, oh
Solo:
   When my star began to fade
   And I found the stage was bare
   I looked into the wings
   I looked into the wings, I looked into the wings
   And you were there
   And you were there
 C H O R U S
   When you saw me getting nowhere
   Trying to find a new direction
   For a stubborn little voice that said I didn't have a prayer
   When my star began to fade
   And I found the stage was bare
   I looked into the wings and you were there I felt like I was falling
