 Talkin' to the mirror, whispering your name
                      It's just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
                      I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
                    Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you How's it goin', might be what I'd say
                      Well you broke my heart you know
                      Or it looks like rain today
                      Or God I've missed you
                      Since you went away
                      You're lookin' well
                      Or go to hell
                      Might be what I'd say There's time I've been so angry
                      I could put my fist right through the wall
                      And then there's times I've come so close
                      To givin' you a call
                      I love you and I hate you
                      All at the same time
                      Then I pray you'll come back to me
                      Before I lose my mind How's it goin', might be what I'd say
                      Well you broke my heart you know
                      Or it looks like rain today
                      Or God I've missed you
                      Since you went away
                      You're lookin' well
                      Or go to hell
                      Might be what I'd say Or maybe, God I've missed you
                      Since you went away
                      You're lookin' well
                      Or go to hell
                      Might be what I'd say
