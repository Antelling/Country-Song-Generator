 
How long has it been?
How long have you held it in?
An' how long will you wait,
Before you let somebody take your breath away again?
I wanna be the one who turns you on,
  Makes love till the lonely's gone.
  Be the man you dreamed of all your life.
  I swear I'll make it last until,
  Tears of joy come pourin' from your eyes.
  I wanna make you cry.
Tell me what to do, 
  And I'll do what you want me to.
  'Cause darlin' I believe,
  That I have fallen hopelessly and helplessy for you.
I wanna be the one who turns you on,
  Makes love till the lonely's gone.
  Be the man you dreamed of all your life.
  I swear I'll make it last until,
  Tears of joy come pourin' from your eyes.
  I wanna make you cry.
Instrumental break.
I swear I'll make it last until,
  Tears of joy come pourin' from your eyes.
  I wanna make you cry.
I wanna make you cry.
