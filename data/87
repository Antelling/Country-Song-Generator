 
ooh....
VERSE 1
  You say you're doin' better
  For your sake I hope it's true
  I wish you well
  But that's all that I can do
  Save your "I'm sorry's"
  Just leave 'em out the door
  You can't make me feel guilty anymore
CHORUS
  You say I should stay with you
  That Jesus forgives you
  You pray I will, but I won't
  The difference is
  Jesus loves you, I don't
VERSE 2
  I know it sounds cruel
  And it's really not like me, but
  You've put me in a place
  I never thought I'd be
  These tears I'm crying
  Are just tears of goodbye
  I hope you find someone else
  Somewhere in your life
  Somewhere in your life
CHORUS
  You say I should stay with you
  That Jesus forgives you
  You pray I will, but I won't
  The difference is
  Jesus loves you, I don't
BRIDGE
  I don't wanna know you still want me
  Don't need to hear you can't sleep
  No I don't, no I don't
CHORUS
  You say I should stay with you
  That Jesus forgives you
  You pray I will, but I won't
  The difference is
  Jesus loves you, Oh I know
  Jesus loves you, I don't
mmhh.....
