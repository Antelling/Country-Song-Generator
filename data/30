 
The leopard with a harmless kid lay down
 And not one savage beast was seen to frown
 The wolf did with the lamb kin dwell in peace
 His grim carnivorous nature there did cease
 The lion with the fatling on did move
 And a little child was leading them in love
 Long ago there was a young painter
   Who had a dream that every creature came
   And stood assembled at his side
   And he painted the sight that had sweetened his night
   Fully one hundred times before he died
A kid and lion and a snake and a child
   Wide-eyed and formal and smiln' like the sun had stopped
   And time had ceased to move
   And th ewolf andthe lamb came and ate from his hand
   And a man-child was leading them in love

   Oh, my friend, have you seen all the lines and the spaces
   The colors that the young painter sees
   In the peacealble kingdom that shines in the faces of people from more gentle times than these
I find myself adrift these days
   An endless maze of ends and ways
   And the world just seems so crazy to me here
   But look away, back or forward from today
   To the visions of either fools or seers
Such a beautiful place full of joy, full of grace
   It was bathed in a saintly yellow light
   Too unlearned to know that such things can't be so
   He could only believe that they might
