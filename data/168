 I'm for the low man on the toedom pole
                      And I'm for the underdog god bless his soul
                      And I'm for the guys still pulling third shift
                      and the single mom raising her kids
                      And I'm for the preacher who stay on their knees
                      And I'm for the sinner who finally believed
                      And I'm For the farmer with dirt on his hands
                    And the soldiers who fight for this land And I'm for the bible
                      And I'm for the flag
                      And I'm for the working man 
                      Me and Ol' hag
                      I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
                      Politically Uncorrect I guess my opinion is all out of style
                      Don't get me started because i can get wild
                      And I'll make a fight for the four father's plan (That's Right)
                      Hell the world already knows where I stand And I'm for the bible
                      And I'm for the flag
                      And I'm for the working man 
                      Me and Ol' hag
                      I'm just one of many who can't get no respect
