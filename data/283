 
Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm as blue as a boy can be
Walking in Memphis
  Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
  Walking in Memphis
  But do I really feel the way I feel
Saw the ghost of Elvis
  On Union Avenue
  Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
  I watched him walk right through
  Now security they did not see him
  They just hovered 'round his tomb
  There's a pretty little thing
  Waiting for "The King"
  Down in the Jungle Room
Walking in Memphis
  Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
  Walking in Memphis
  Do I really feel the way I feel
They've got catfish on the table
  They've got gospel in the air
  And Reverend Green be glad to see you
  When you haven't got a prayer
  You've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Muriel plays the piano
  Every Friday at the Hollywood
  And they brought me down to see her
  And they asked me if I would
  Do a little number
  And I sang with all my might
  She said
"Tell me are you a Christain"
  I said "Ma'am I am tonight"
