 It�s like jumping, it�s like leaping
It�s like walking on the ceiling
It�s like floating, it�s like flying
Through the air
It�s like soaring, it�s like gliding
It�s a rocket ship you�re riding
It�s a feeling that can take you anywhere
So why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  I don�t know
There was passion, there was laughter
  The first morning after
  I just couldn�t get my feet to touch the ground
  Everytime we were together
  We talked about forever
  I was certain it was Heaven
  We had found
So why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  I don�t know
But you can�t live your life
  Walking in the clouds
  Sooner or later
  You have to come down
It�s like a knife through the heart
  When it all comes apart
  It�s like someone takes a pin
  To your balloon
  It�s a hole, it�s a cave
  It�s kinda like a grave
  When he tells you that he�s found somebody new
So why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  Now I know
  Now I know

 So why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  Why they call it falling
  I don�t know There was passion, there was laughter
  The first morning after
  I just couldn�t get my feet to touch the ground
  Everytime we were together
  We talked about forever
  I was certain it was Heaven
