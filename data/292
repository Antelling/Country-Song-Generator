 Where'd you get the number
Where'd you get the matches
In a motel room
Were they lying in a drawer with your old
boyscott badges
I think I know the truth
CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
  You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
  Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
  'till the next one comes
  And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun
It's a little bit sad
  A little bit tragic
  The way oyu run around
  And if love was a drug you'd be an addict
  You're so afraid to come down
CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
  You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
  Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
  'till the next one comes
And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun
Oneday you're gonna say goodbye
  And someone's gonna take it too well
  Maybe even look you in the eye
  Like it's a cold day in hell
  And you;re the last fire
CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
  You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
  Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
  'till the next one comes
  And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun

 CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
  You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
  Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
  'till the next one comes
  And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun It's a little bit sad
  A little bit tragic
  The way oyu run around
  And if love was a drug you'd be an addict
  You're so afraid to come down CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
  You burn through lovers like a chain-smokin', sweet talkin', son of a gun
  Anything it takes to keep your loneliness on the run
  'till the next one comes
And the last fire is ashes in the mornings sun Oneday you're gonna say goodbye
  And someone's gonna take it too well
  Maybe even look you in the eye
  Like it's a cold day in hell
  And you;re the last fire CHORUS:
  'Cause the last fire always lights the next one
