 [Verse 1]
                      Little boy walks in with a bloody nose,
                      Got beat up on his way home from school, 
                      again,
                      His dad caught him running out the back,
                      Tears in his eyes and a baseball bat, 
                    oo revenge, [Bridge]
                      Said son I won't stop ya
                      but before you go
                      Let me tell you a little story 
                      bout the toughest man I know [Chorus]
                      You hit him 
                      and he just turns the other cheek,
                      Don't think for a minute he was weak,
                      Cause in the end he showed them,
                      He was any-thing but frail,
                      They hammered him to a cross,
                      But he was tougher than nails, [Verse 2]
                      Well he droped that bat 
                      like it weighed a ton,
                      Father put his arms around his son 
                      and said just let it go--oo,
                      Believe me I've been in your shoes, 
                      Had to ask myself what would Jesus do, 
                      here's what I know, (bridge)
                      Whenever I'm in doubt
                      I look up what he said
                      It's all there in the good book 
                      in black and whitnd red (chorus)
                      Hit him and he just turns the other cheek,
                      Don't think for a minute he was weak,
                      Cause in the end he showed them,
                      He was any-thing but frail,
                      They hammered him to a cross,
                      But he was tougher than nails,
                      Yea in the end he showed them,
                      He was any-thing but frail,
                      They hammered him to a cross,
                      But he was tougher than nails,
                      Tougher than nails, oh, oh, oh,
