 If there's a plane or a bus leavin' Dallas I hope you're on it
                     If there's a train movin' fast down the tracks I hope you caught it
                     'Cause I swear out there ain't where you oughta be
                     So catch a ride catch a cab don't ya know I miss ya bad
                     But don't you walk to me Baby run cut a path across the blue skies
                      Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
                      Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
                      Leave Dallas in the dust I need you in a rush
                      So baby run If you ain't got a suitcase get a box or an old brown paper sack
                      Pack it light or pack it heavy take a truck take a Chevy
                      Baby just come back
                      There's a short cut to the highway out of town why don't you take it
                      Don't let that speed limit slow you down go on and break it Baby run cut a path across the blue skies
                      Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
                      Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
                      Leave Dallas in the dust I need you in a rush
                      So baby run
