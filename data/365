 
Here we go again
On this telephone line
Everytime we talk I always end up cryin
You’re always telling me about what I’m missing
If I came back there I’d only end up wishing
Mamma I can come home but I can’t stay long
  Gotta make a little money tryin to sing my song
  My heart’s still there even though I’m gone
  I’ve put my roots deep in the ground of that tiny town
I can remember all the things you’ve said
  I hear your sweet voice talking in my head
  I’m a Mississippi girl, know I won’t forget it
  But if I don’t stay here I know I’m going to regret it
Mamma I can come home but I can’t stay long
  Gotta make a little money tryin’ to sing my song
  My hearts still there even though I’m gone
  I’ve put my roots deep in the ground of that tiny town 
I feel your arms around me like it's yesterday
  I’m still daddy’s little girl and I wont go away
  You know that I’m a dreamer and I’ve got to do this, gotta do this
  But know that I wish
  That I could come home 
  I just can’t stay long
  Gotta make a little money tryin’ to sing my songs
  My hearts still there even though I’m gone
  I put my roots deep in the ground
  Of that tiny town
  Of that tiny town
  Of that tiny town
 Mamma I can come home but I can’t stay long
  Gotta make a little money tryin to sing my song
  My heart’s still there even though I’m gone
  I’ve put my roots deep in the ground of that tiny town I can remember all the things you’ve said
  I hear your sweet voice talking in my head
  I’m a Mississippi girl, know I won’t forget it
  But if I don’t stay here I know I’m going to regret it Mamma I can come home but I can’t stay long
  Gotta make a little money tryin’ to sing my song
  My hearts still there even though I’m gone
