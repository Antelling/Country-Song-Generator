 (1st verse) Well you filled up my head,
                      With so many lies.
                      Twisted my heart
                      Til something snapped inside.
                      I'd like to give it one more try
                      but my give a damn's busted. You can crawl back home
                      say you were wrong,
                      stand out in the yard
                      cry all night long.
                      Well go ahead and water my lawn.
                      My give a damn's busted. (chorus) I really wanna care,
                      I wanna feel somethin'
                      Let me dig a little deeper...
                      Nope...
                      Sorry...
                      Nothin' (2nd verse) You can say you've got issues.
                      You can say you're a victim.
                      It's all your parents fault,
                      After all you didn't pick em
                      Well maybe Oprah's got time to listen.
                      My give a damn's busted. (*Well let me get this straight now)
                      Your therapist said
                      It was all just a phase 
                      A product of the prozac
                      And your co-dependent ways
                      So uhh ... who's your new neighbor these days
                      My give a damn's busted. (chorus) I really wanna care,
                      I wanna feel somethin'
                      Let me dig a little deeper...
                      Eeh-Eeh (3rd verse)
                      (*Oh you're tellin' me)
                      It's a desperate situation,
                      No tellin' what you'll do.
                      If I don't forgive you,
                      You say your life is through.
                      Well honey... give me somethin' I can use.
                      (My give a damn's busted.)

                      (*Get the party started thats what we'll do)
                      My give a damn's busted
