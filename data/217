 Changin' lanes and talkin' on the phone 
                      Drivin' way too fast 
                      The interstate's jammed with gunners like me 
                      Afraid of comin' in last 
                      But somewhere in the race we run 
                    We're comin' undone  
                      Days go by 
                      I can feel them flyin' 
                      Like a hand out the window in the wind 
                      Cars go by 
                      Yeah, it's all we've been given 
                      So we better start livin' right now 
                    'Cause days go by  I was on the roof just the other night 
                      And watched the world flash by 
                      Headlights, taillights and runnin' through the river 
                      Of neon signs 
                      But somewhere in the rush I felt 
                      We're losin' ourselves  (Repeat Chorus)  We think about tomorrow, then it slips away 
                      We talk about forever but we've only got today  Days go by 
                      I can feel them flyin' 
                      Like a hand out the window as the cars go by 
                      Yeah, it's all we've been given 
                      So we'd better start livin' 
                      We'd better start livin' 
                      We'd better start livin' right now  (Repeat Chorus)  'Cause days go by 
                      So take them by the hand 
                      And in your mind 
                      Take them by the hand 
                      And live your life 
                      Take them by your hand 
                      Don't let your life fly by 
                      Come on 
                      Come on now 
                      Don't you know the days go by
