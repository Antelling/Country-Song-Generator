 Counted the stars on the 4th of July
Wishing they were rockets bursting into the sky
Talking about redemption and leaving things behind
As the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
As fierce as Monday morning feeling washed away
  Our orchestrated paradise couldn't make you stay
  You dance with the horses through the sands of time
  As the sun sinks west of the Mendocino County Line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
  To remind me of a time
  These pictures and these photographs
  Let me know I'm doin' fine
  I used to make you happy once upon a time
  But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
The two of us together felt nothin' but right
  Feeling you near immortal every Friday night
  Lost in our convictions left stained with wine
  As the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
I have these pictures and I keep these photographs
  To remain me of a time
  These pictures and these photographs
  Let me know I'm doin' fine
  I used to make you happy once upon a time
  But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County Line
I don't talk to you too much these days
  I just thank the lord pictures don't fade
  I spent time with an angel just passing through
  Now all that's left is this image of you
