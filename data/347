 Cool, yeah 
                      You're so complicated 
                      You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail 
                      I don't appreciate it 
                      When I talk to other guys 
                      You think they're on my tail 
                      I get so aggravated, when I get off the phone 
                      And get the third degree 
                      I'm really feeling frustrated 
                      Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me 
                      And you'll see 
                      Don't freak out until you know the facts 
                      Relax  1 - Don't be stupid 
                      You know I love you 
                      Don't be ridiculous 
                      You know I need you 
                      Don't be absurd 
                      You know I want you 
                      Don't be impossible  Oh, oh...  2 - I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you) 
                      I can't live without you (Can't live without you) 
                      I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)  Don't be stupid, you know I love you  Oh, 
                      Stop overreacting 
                      You even get suspicious when I paint my nails 
                      It's definitely distracting 
                      The way you dramatize every little small detail 
                      Don't freak out until you know the facts 
                      Relax, Max  Repeat 1  Oh, oh no no  Repeat 2  Don't be stupid, you know I love you  Ow! 
                      Don't be stupid 
                      Oh, ah, oh, ah 
                      You're my baby  Repeat 2  Repeat 1  Impossible 
                      Oh no, no, no 
                      Don't be, don't be, don't be baby 
                      Don't be ridiculous, oh, oh, no, no 
                      Oh don't be stupid
