 
(Jimmy Buffett):
Hear 'em singing 'Happy Birthday'
Better think about the wish I make
This year gone by
Ain't no piece of cake
(Martina McBride):
  Every day's a revolution
  Put 'em together and it comes undone
  Just one more candle and
  A trip around the sun
Chorus (Both):
  I'm just hanging on while this old world keeps spinning
  And it's good to know it's out of my control
  If there's one thing that I've learned from all this living
  It's that it wouldn't change a thing if I let go
(Martina McBride):
  Though you never see it coming
  Always wind up wondering where it went
(Jimmy Buffett):
  Only time will tell
  If it was time well spent
  It's another revelation
(Martina McBride):
  Celebrating what I should have done
  With these souvenirs from my trip around the sun
Chorus (Both):
  I'm just hanging on while this old world keeps spinning
  And it's good to know it's out of my control
  If there's one thing that I've learned from all this living
It's that it wouldn't change a thing if I let go
(Jimmy Buffett):
  Yes, I'll make a resolution
(Martina McBride):
  That I'll never make another one
(Both):
  Just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
Just enjoy this ride on my trip around the sun
(Jimmy Buffett):
  Just enjoy this ride until it's done
 (Martina McBride):
  Every day's a revolution
  Put 'em together and it comes undone

  A trip around the sun Chorus (Both):
