 
How he got that GI Joe in the church this morning, 
I don't know but he ain't listening to the preacher, 
Like his mama taught him to. 
She's wanting me to cross the aisle, 
Go, sit over there with him awhile, 
Make him turn around and sit up straight, 
Stop playing in the pew. 
To watch him is all that I can do.
'Cause I look at him and I see a boy, 
  An' I see trouble and I see joy. 
  See innocence and headstrong, 
  And a heart full of dreams. 
  An' I look at him and I'm so amazed: 
  I'm so proud and then so afraid, 
  That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree. 
  Yeah, I look at him and I see me. 
Already says, when he grows up, 
  He's gonna have a big ol' truck, 
  An' I can see him getting stuck on some private property. 
  He'll take chances, he'll take dare's, 
  And keep his Momma and me scared to death. 
  When he goes out at night, 
  You know, I'll bet we'll never sleep. 
  I guess I get what my Dad got from me. 
Cause' I look at him and I see a teen, 
  Havin' fun doing stupid things. 
  I see roadblocks, I see mistakes: 
  I see heartbreak he can't see. 
  I look at him an' I'm so amazed: 
  I'm so proud and then so afraid, 
  That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree. 
  Oh, I look at him and I see me. 
I look at him and I see me, 
  Breakin' down one day, 
  As he packs up all his things, 
  To move away. 
I look at him an' I'm so amazed: 
  I'm so proud and then so afraid, 
  That the apple didn't fall quite far enough from the tree. 
  Yeah, I look at him and I see me.
