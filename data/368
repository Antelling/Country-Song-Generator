 
Alone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head
 Painting a picture of you
 And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
 Just the road and its majesty
 And I�m looking at you with the world in the rear view
Chorus-
   You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat 
   Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be, 
   With me on the 4th of July
   We sang Stranglehold to the stereo 
   Couldn�t take no more of that rock n roll
   So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you aint got no one
   To keep you hanging on
   And there you were like a queen with your nightgown, riding shotgun from town to town 
   Staking a claim on the world we found
   And I�m singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a boy like me

Chorus-
   You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat 
   Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be, 
   With me on the 4th of July
   We sang Stranglehold to the stereo 
   Couldn�t take no more of that rock n roll
   So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

and im looking for you in the silence that we share

Chorus-
   You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat 
   Looking at me, telling me you love me ,and your happy to be, 
   With me on the 4th of July
   We sang Stranglehold to the stereo 
   Couldn�t take no more of that rock n roll
   So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
