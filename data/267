 You don't know me but I know who you are
Mind if I sit down
Do I look familiar if I don't well I should
I'm sure you've seen me around
I know you've probably heard my name
Though we've not been introduced
I'm the fool in love with the fool
Who's still in love with you
If you've got a minute I'll buy you a drink
  I've got something to say
  It might sound crazy but last night in his sleep
  I heard him call out your name
  This ain't the first time he's done it before
  And it's hard to face the truth
  I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you
I know love is a fragile thing
  And I'm trying hard to make it last
  But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
  When he's holding on to the past
Just one more thing before I go
  I'm not here to put you down
  You don't love him and that's a fact
  Girl I've seen you around
  But you hold his heart in the palm of your hand
  And it's breaking mine in two
  'Cause I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you
I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you
 If you've got a minute I'll buy you a drink
  I've got something to say
  It might sound crazy but last night in his sleep
  I heard him call out your name
  This ain't the first time he's done it before
  And it's hard to face the truth
  I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you I know love is a fragile thing
  And I'm trying hard to make it last
  But it ain't easy holding on to my dream
  When he's holding on to the past Just one more thing before I go
  I'm not here to put you down
  You don't love him and that's a fact
  Girl I've seen you around
  But you hold his heart in the palm of your hand
  And it's breaking mine in two
  'Cause I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you I'm the fool in love with the fool
  Who's still in love with you
