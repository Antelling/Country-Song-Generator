 (verse)
                      Every day after Thanksgiving sell,
                      Malls just ain't complete,
                      Without a bunch of decorations and a paper angel tree,
 (bridge)
                      There's artificial smiles on artificial tree limbs,
                      sayin what she'd love to have and what to buy for him,
 (verse 2)
                      Well I hope Maggie likes her new winter clothes,
                      And her buggie with a baby doll,
                      And maybe Thomas smile in his new Nike shoes,
                      When he shoots that basketball, (bridge)
                      I can't help but wishin, that I could do more,
                      But not just while I'm shoping in the department store,
 (chorus)
                      Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
                      No matter where you are right now,
                      Remember God's right there,
                      He's asking all of us,
                      To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere, (verse 3)
                      Goin through the mail on this stary afternoon,
                      I see a mom and dad's worse dream,
                      Their on the back of a money-savin-add,
                      To get my carpet clean, (bridge)
                      Height, weight, hair, eyes, date missin, and D.O.B.
                      A child's picture and the words Have you see me, (chorus)
                      Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
                      No matter where you are right now,
                      Remember God's right there,
                      He's asking all of us,
                      To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere (bridge)
                      His documented bruises, film, a folder and a file,
                      She's a second grade self portrait drawn without a smile,
                      And every town has litter with this kind of debree,
                      We've got to stop this madness, it's up to you and me (chorus)
                      Paper angels you're in my thoughts and prayers,
                      No matter where you are right now,
                      Remember God's right there,
                      He's asking all of us,
                      To help take care of all his paper angels everywhere,
                      Paper angels everywhere
