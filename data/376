 Sun’s comin’ up on a sunday mornin’.
                      I’m lookin’ out the window at a beautiful view.
                      Turn on the tv an’ somebody’s talkin’,
                      ’bout the wrong and the right and the ultimate truth.
                      I listen for a minute but my heart is somewhere else,
                    ’cause I’ve got my own convictions but I keep them to myself. When I feel the world around me,
                      How can I not believe? 
                      If I’m high up on a mountain,
                      Or down on my knees,
                      It’s just between God and me. Secrets I’ve been holding.
                      Tears cried, nobody else sees.
                      Sometimes I’m alone,
                      But I know there’s somebody watching over me.
                      There’s so much I’m afraid of an’ I’m really not that strong.
                      But there’s one place I can go to where all the fear is gone. When I feel the world around me,
                      How can I not believe? 
                      If I’m high up on a mountain,
                      Or down on my knees,
                      It’s just between God and me. Every picture’s painted differently.
                      Every one has got a vision in their mind.
                      That fills the heart with answers,
                      And the missin’ piece that we hope to find.
                      And this is mine. When I feel the world around me,
                      How can I not believe? 
                      If I’m high up on a mountain,
                      Or down on my knees. When I feel the world around me,
                      How can I not believe? 
                      If I’m high up on a mountain,
                      Or down on my knees,
                      It’s just between God and me. God and me.
                      It’s just between God and me.
