 I don't feel like loving you today,
                      So don't you even try to change my mind,
                      The best thing you can do right now,
                      Is just go away,
                    Cause I don't feel like loving you today, I don't wanna talk about last night,
                      I'm angry and I haven't had much sleep,
                      And I'm so tired and bloodshot,
                      There's no tellin' what I'd say,
                      I don't feel like loving you today, But you know I will anyway,
                      Even though we make it hard sometimes,
                      I'll wind up forgiving and probably loving you,
                      For the rest of my life,
                      But I don't feel like loving you today,
                      And I've got 16 hours left to go,
                      I might tell you that I'm leaving,
                      Even though you know I'll stay,
                      Cause I don't feel like loving you today, But you know I will anyway,
                      Even though we make it hard sometimes,
                      I'll wind up forgiving and probably loving you,
                      For the rest of my life,
                      But I don't feel like loving you today, I just don't feel like loving you today
