 I can’t stand the smell of smoke
But I bought myself a pack
Bummed a light from a stranger
Nearly choked from that first drag
And I hate the taste of whiskey
  And this barroom ain’t my style
  But I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
Seems like forever since I looked
  into the eyes of another man
  In my lifetime I’ve never known a one-night stand.
  Lord knows it’s wrong to let a stranger
  turn out your bedroom light.
  But I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I’m tired, so tired of crying
  Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
  So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
  I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
  I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while

It ain’t like me to be a cussin’
  Getting tore up in this bar
  Guess a good ole girl can backslide
  Running from a broken heart
  I pray the good Lord ain’t a lookin
  And taking notes on me tonight
  Cause I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I’m tired, so tired of crying
  Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
  So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
  I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
I’m tired, so tired of crying
  Tired of reaching for a memory in the middle of a night
  So sick of pain running through my veins overtaking my whole life
  I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while
  I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while And I hate the taste of whiskey
  And this barroom ain’t my style
  But I’ll try anything not to hurt for a while Seems like forever since I looked
  into the eyes of another man
  In my lifetime I’ve never known a one-night stand.
