 I was born to travel down blue highways
                      I never seem to learn much from my past
                      I don't make excuses for my mistakes
                      I take each day and I live it
                    Like it was my last I don't look back
                      One foot in front of the other
                      On this one way track I don't look back
                      I live my life my way
                      I don't look back I'm sure there's memories I've missed out on
                      There's been a couple of loves I've left behind
                      I haven't found a heart hat I can count on
                      But don't feel sorry for me
                      I ain't the lonesome kind I don't look back
                      One foot in front of the other
                      On this one way track
                      I don't look back
                      I live my life my way
                      I don't look back
                      No I don't look back I don't look back
                      One foot in front of the other
                      On this one way track
                      I don't look back
                      I live my life my way
                      I don't look back
                      I live my life my way
                      I don't look back
                      No I don't look back
                      No, no I don't look back
                      I don't look back
