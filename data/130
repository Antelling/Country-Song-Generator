 
Some day I'm gonna drive me a faster car
Park in front of a house with a bigger yard
I'm gonna break my back, I'm gonna bust my tail
Taking everything another notch upscale
I won't fail
But I'll never, ever do better than you
  When it comes to your love, baby
  I've already done the best I can do
  It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you
One day I'm gonna hit a little bigger lick
  And I'll bring you home an even bigger check
  One morning fortune's gonna smile on me
  I'm gonna go even higher than I aim to be
  Wait and see
(Chorus 2x)
  But I'll never, ever do better than you
  When it comes to your love, baby
  I've already done the best I can do
  It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you
Oh, there's nothing better than you
  Never better than you 

 But I'll never, ever do better than you
  When it comes to your love, baby
  I've already done the best I can do
  It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you One day I'm gonna hit a little bigger lick
  And I'll bring you home an even bigger check
  One morning fortune's gonna smile on me
  I'm gonna go even higher than I aim to be
  Wait and see (Chorus 2x)
  But I'll never, ever do better than you
  When it comes to your love, baby
  I've already done the best I can do
  It's so true
I'll never, ever do better than you Oh, there's nothing better than you
  Never better than you
