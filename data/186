 I'm a piece of work, I'm iron and lace
                      I'm shy, I'm right up in your face
                      I'm all dumbfounded, stubborn as an ass
                      Sharp as an arrow in a pile of glass.
                      I'm a sweetheart, genius, reckless jerk.
                    Lord, have mercy, I'm a piece of work. Well the Lord made me on a long thin limb
                      Made sure I'd remeber him or her
                      In the middle of a long dark night
                      Creation crazy, death-sheet white
                      Made in the image of a lion shocked lamb
                      I am who the hell I am
                      Even better, bad to worse,
                      Down to the letter, I'm a piece of work. I'm a piece of work I'm an angels fiend
                      Bathed in lavender and gasoline
                      Scared brave, shallow in an ink black well
                      Lightly browned in the fires of hell
                      Wicked, holy, full on fake
                      Best known for my big mistake
                      I'm zen wise, peaceful, gone berserk
                      Good God almighty, What a piece of work. I'm a dreadful sight, I just don't care
                      Spent all morning pull out my hair
                      Woke at dawn with a crazy spin
                      I was half the day trying to glue back in
                      Mother, bloody mary, please
                      Wipe that smile right off your knees
                      I'm the CEO of the mailroom clerks
                      Lord have mercy, I'm a piece of work. I'm a piece of work, I'm a love sick boy
                      Cloth cap, caviar, and corduroy
                      All over the map, justa lost in space
                      With a filthy mind and a choirboy's face
                      Heels up, head down, straight on through
                      Watch out woman, I'm a get to you
                      I'm a gladiator with a mind to irk
                      I'm a see you later, I'm a piece of work.
