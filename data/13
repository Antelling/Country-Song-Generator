 Somewhere there's a stolen halo
                      I use to watch her wear it well
                      Everything would shine wherever she would go
                    But looking at her now you'd never tell Someone ran away with her innocence
                      A memory she can't get out of her head
                      I can only imagine what she's feeling
                      When she's praying
                      Kneeling at the edge of her bed And she says take me away
                      And take me farther
                      Surround me now
                      And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
                      Holy water She wants someone to call her angel
                      Someone to put the light back in her eyes
                      She's looking through the faces
                      The unfamiliar places
                      She needs someone to hear her when she crys And she says take me away
                      And take me farther
                      Surround me now
                      And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
                      Holy water She just needs a little help
                      To wash away the pain she's felt
                      She wants to feel the healing hands
                      Of someone who understands And she says take me away
                      And take me farther
                      Surround me now
                      And hold, hold, hold me
                      And she says take me away
                      And take me farther
                      Surround me now
                      And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
                      Holy water
