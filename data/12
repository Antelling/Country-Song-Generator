 I cant count the barns Ive passed
                      Painted red, white and black
                      See Rock City
                      And up ahead theres a turn
                      Takes me right through Gadlinburg
                      I hear its pretty
                      Maybe some other time, I cant slow down
                    Right across that state line, right about now Her hair still wet from her bath
                      She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
                      In my sweatshirt, in her barefeet, this I gotta see
                      If I hurry I can catch
                      The colors on her skin from that sunset
                      Her face and that look waitin on me, this I gotta see. I cant wait to get to her, man
                      I wish I were there already
                      Shes the only thing that keeps this world from driving me crazy
                      I just hit that city limit
                      Yeah, thats a pretty good sign
                      And if I pick it up a bit, Ill be right on time Her hair still wet from her bath
                      She's sitting on the front porch with a glass of iced tea
                      In my sweatshirt, in her barefeet, this I gotta see
                      If I hurry I can catch
                      The colors on her skin from that sunset
                      Her face and that look waitin on me, this I gotta see.
