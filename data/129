 Every morning when I wake up
I pour coffee in my cup
And I look out on the fields
Of the land that I call home
And if there's no chance of rain
And I need to get away
I'll grab a saddle
And be long, long gone
(Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
  Looks like a good day to ride
There's a world that's in a race
  For some money and some fame
  But out here there's nothin'
  All I need is what I have
  So when I wanna free my mind
  From the concrete in the sides
  I head for the mountains
  Back to who I am
(Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
Wow
(Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
Looks like a good day to ride, yeah (Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
  Looks like a good day to ride There's a world that's in a race
  For some money and some fame
  But out here there's nothin'
  All I need is what I have
  So when I wanna free my mind
  From the concrete in the sides
  I head for the mountains
  Back to who I am (Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride Wow (Chorus)
  Looks like a good day to ride
  Underneath this big warm sun
  Looks like a good day
  To let this old boy fly
  Loose on the reins and on the run
  To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride Looks like a good day to ride, yeah
