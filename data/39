 Shootin' dr. Pepper cans with your brand new red ryder
                      That old folding lawn chair makes the perfect x-wing fighter
                      Those no-name baseball cards spinning in your spokes
                    Now that's cool Turnin' 17 and daddy loosens up the curfew
                      Drivin' home at midnight that old buick smells like perfume
                      Making your own money, having coffee with your folks
                      Now that's cool (Chorus:)
                      Knowin' where you're goin' embracin' where you've been
                      Being criticized for standin' strong in a battle you can't win
                      Livin' in a moment you may never see again
                      Let your heart break some rules
                      Now that's cool Wakin' up with your new bride a room beside the ocean
                      10 years later goin' back to relive that emotion
                      She tells you what she's thinking but never says a word
                      Now that's cool (Chorus) The pitcher is your six year old, you're his full time catcher
                      He gets a new bb gun and 'you'll put your eye out' lecture
                      Your 3 year old is singin' the song that she just learned
                      Now that's cool (Chorus)
