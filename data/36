 
She's a momma's baby 
She's her daddy's pride and joy 
They've kept her under eyes 
She ain't been hangin out 
with any ugly actin boy
Hardly ever been kissed 
  Twenty years of inosence 
  Just what im lookin for 
  I wanna be the man whos a 
  Holdin her hand when she cant hold it back 
  anymore 
Good little girls 
  make some mighty wild women 
  Been saving it up 
  since the very beginning 
  When They fall in love 
  they wanna take it to the limit 
  Good little girls 
  make some mighty wild women 
well shes never been to Vegas 
  or danced in a honky tonk 
  no trail of broken hearts 
  Although she looks the part 
  That aint the kind of life she wants 
  Shes waiting for a gold ring 
  before she tries her way 
  Thats what im waiting for 
I wanna be the man 
  who's a holding her hand 
  when she cant hold it back no more
