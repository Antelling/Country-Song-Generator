 
Knocked on his door last night
 He shoulda' been there
 I waited till 6pm
 Lord, I'm worryin' again
 Said he messed up something real bad
 Whatever it is
 I'll be there
 C H O R U S:
   I'll pray for him
   Hope he's alright
   Fells like he's all alone
   Against the world tonight
   He's gone away
   Lord, help me pray for him
Told him he's got to believe
   There's a lot to believe in
   Doesn't think he good enough
   Says it doesn't matter much
   If I were walkin' in his shoes
   He'd be there for me
   He'd know what to do
C H O R U S:
   I'll pray for him
   Hope he's alright
   Fells like he's all alone
   Against the world tonight
   He's gone away
 Lord, help me pray for him
BRIDGE:
   I've done everything I can do
   I leave it in your hands
   Lord, it's up to you
C H O R U S:
   I'll pray for him
   Hope he's alright
   Fells like he's all alone
   Against the world tonight
   He's gone away
 Lord, help me pray for him
 C H O R U S:
   I'll pray for him
   Hope he's alright
   Fells like he's all alone
   Against the world tonight
   He's gone away
