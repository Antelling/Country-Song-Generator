 I have wondered this world far and wide
                    I've been all around to the other side
                    But there's nothin' like comin' home
                    I wanna sit on my front porch and drink my lemonade
                    Cut my grass after church every Sunday
                    And go out on Saturday night
                    Live the simple life
                    Wake up in the morning to these fields of gold
                    And take a long walk down a gravel road Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
                    Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
                    Know that I'll always have someone to hold
                    Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life I wanna take a blanket down to the creek
                    And let the water sing me to sleep
                    Let go of time
                    Live the simple life
                    Lately I've seen too many city lights
                    I wanna go somewhere where I can see the stars at night Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
                    Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
                    Know that I'll always have someone to hold
                    Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life Spend my days in the sweet sunshine
                    Rock in my swing and watch my garden grow
                    Know that I'll always have someone to hold
                    Oh I-I-I wanna live the simple life
