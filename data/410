 We got winners; we got losers;
                      Chain smokers and boozers. 
                      An' we got yuppies; we got bikers; 
                      An' we got, thirsty hitchhikers.
                      And the girls next door dress up like movie stars:
                      Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
                      We got cowboys; we got truckers; 
                      Broken hearted fools and suckers.
                      An' we got husslers; we got fighters; 
                      Early birds and all nighters.
                      And the veterans talk about their battle scars: 
                    Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar. I love this bar,
                      It's my kind place.
                      Just walk in through the front door,
                      Puts a big smile on my face.
                      It ain't too far; come as you are. 
                      Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar. I've seen short skirts; we've got high-techs;
                      Blue collar boys and rednecks.
                      An' we got lovers; lots of lookers;
                      I've even seen dancin' girls and hookers.
                      And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar: 
                      Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar, yes I do! I like my truck, (I like my truck),
                      An' I like my girlfriend, (I like my girlfriend),
                      I like to take her out to dinner; 
                      I like a movie now and then: But I love this bar,
                      It's my kind place.
                      Just toeing around the dance floor, 
                      Puts a big smile on my face.
                      No cover charge; come as you are. 
                      Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I love this bar.
                      Mm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm, I just love this ol' bar.
