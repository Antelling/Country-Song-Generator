 Sunny days seem to hurt the most
                      Wear the pain like a heavy coat
                      I feel you everywhere I go
                      See your smile, I see your face
                      I hear you laughing in the rain
                    Still can't believe your gone (Chorus:)
                      It ain't fair you died to young
                      Like a story that had just begun
                      But death tore the pages all away
                      God knows how I miss you
                      All the hell that I've been through
                      Just knowing, no one could take your place
                      Sometimes I wonder, who you'd be today Would you see the world
                      Would you chase your dreams
                      Settle down with a family
                      I wonder what would you name your babies
                      Someday's the sky's so blue
                      I feel like I can talk to you
                      And I know it might sound crazy (Chorus) Today [3x]
                      Today [3x] Sunny days seem to hurt the most
                      I wear the pain like a heavy coat
                      The only thing that gives me hope
                      Is I know, I'll see you again someday Someday, someday
