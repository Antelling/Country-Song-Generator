 

You picked me up at seven
I could see it in your eyes
And halfway through the movie
It was still on both our minds
So why put it off one minute more
Let's do what we wanted to
When I first opened the door
Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
The way we're both distracted
It makes it hard to talk
This ice is easily broken
If we trust in what we got
Kiss me now...cause you know you will
Kiss me now...why wait until
The end of the night when it's awkward and shy
And there's so much at stake that we're too scared to try
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
You don't have to ask
You know what I'll say
And who knows what will happen next
If we get it out of the way
Kiss me now...why go on like this
Kiss me now...get it over with
I'll make it easy on you
I want you to kiss me now
