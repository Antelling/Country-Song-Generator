 I'm gonna take that mountain.  I was born a stubborn soul.
                      Ain't afraid of the great unknown,
                      Nor the windin road thats all uphill.
                      This is just a stumblin' block;
                      Intimidating wall of rock.
                      If you think this broken heart will break my will. I'm gonna take that mountain.
                      Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
                      And there ain't no way around it. 
                      Gonna leave it level with the ground.
                      Ain't just gonna cross it,climb it, fight it:
                      I'm gonna take that mountain. 
 It's overwhelmin', lookin' up.
                      An' knowin' it's the challenge of me,
                      Against this heartache to survive.
                      I may slip an' I may fall,
                      But even if I have to crawl,
                      I'll break through to the healin' side 
 I'm gonna take that mountain.
                      Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
                      And there ain't no way around it.
                      Gonna leave it level with the ground.
                      Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it:
                      I'm gonna take that mountain.  Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it:  Yeah, I'm gonna take that mountain.
                      Ain't nothing gonna slow me down.
                      And there ain't no way around it.
                      Gonna leave it level with the ground.
                      Ain't just gonna cross it, climb it, fight it:
                      I'm gonna take that mountain.  I was born a stubborn soul;
                      This is just a stumblin' block;
