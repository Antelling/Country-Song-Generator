 
She drove South I-95 straight though Carolina 
She didn’t use no damn map to find her way 
She pulled off on the state route just north of Charlotte 
And took mostly country roads the rest of the day
She said I’ll give him an intentional heartache 
  That’ll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me 
  Would you all step back so a girl might to get started 
  And he won’t have to look twice to see 
She drove up across the yard and though his momma’s garden 
  Didn’t touch the brakes, she slammed right into his Chevrolet 
  Tossed out his clothes, boots, bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster 
  Then shot the whole mess neon green with a can of Dupont spray 
(Repeat Chorus) 
She said I’ll give you an intentional heartache 
  That’ll hurt a lot worse than the one that you left in me 
  And tell your little tramp to step back so your ex wife can get started 
  And you won’t have to look twice to see 
Just watch this 
  Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green 
  Said Connie put that can of spray paint down 
  Just watch this 
  Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too 
  Put the can down Connie 
  She give it hell with that can of spray paint 
  He kept yelling at her just put the can down 
  So she sprayed him 
  Then she did a dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster 
  Just kind of a hoochie coochie 
  Alright Connie 
  He said I saw you Connie, now put it down 
  Just watch this, she run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo 
  And she sprayed tramp 
  On the hood on the back of the house 
  We tried to call her sister 
  What was that girls name 
  Said you gotta come get this girl 
  Nancy, I think 
  She said watch this 
  Said Lookee here lookee here, watch this 
  She run that girl back up on the porch 
  Screamin' at her tramp this 
  Oh yeah 
  She give him an intentional heartache 
  Alright, alright Connie I heard you 
  His momma was crying in there on the phone 
  His daddy said 
  I told you that girl was gonna get like that 
  She said watch this, here
 She said I’ll give him an intentional heartache 
  That’ll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
