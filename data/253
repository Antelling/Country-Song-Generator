 
I’ve been waitin’ on that how down train
It’s been a long, long week
And I swear nothings gonna get in my way
With my high heals on and my wrangler jeans
My favorite wet n wild lipstick
Number 503
Its time right now let’s throw it down
All you girls stand up
  Throw ya hands up
  Come on let’s rock
  Gonna go all night
  Gonna watch the dust fly
  Show ‘em what we got
  Come on let’s take a ride on the top of the world
  All you soul shakin heart breakin lil’ cow girls
Woo yee haw
Three shots in and we’re up on that bar
  Everybody cheers us on and we shine
  Like crushed gold stars
  Turn that jukebox up
  Lay your money down
  All you cowgirls here
  Yippee yay coyote for another round
  Jump on in here we go again
All you girls stand up
  Throw ya hands up
  Come on let’s rock
  Gonna go all night
