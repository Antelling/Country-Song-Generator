 I pulled into the shopping center
                      And saw a little boy wrapped
                      Around the legs of his mother
                      Like ice cream melting
                      They embraced
                      Years of bad decisions
                      Running down her face
                      All morning I'd been
                      Thinking my life's so hard
                      And they wore everything
                      They owned living in a car
                      I wanted to tell 'em
                      It would be OK
                      But I just got in my suburban
                      And I drove away I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry
                      I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry I keep having this dream
                      About my old man
                      I'm 10 years old and
                      He's holding my hand
                      We're talking on the front porch
                      Watching the sun go down
                      But it was just a dream
                      He was a slave to his job
                      And he couldn't be around
                      So many things I wanna say to him
                      But I just placed
                      A rose on his grave
                      And I talked to the wind I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry
                      I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry I'm sitting here with
                      My kids and my wife
                      And everything that
                      I hold dear in my life
                      We say grace and
                      Thank the Lord
                      Got so much to be thankful for
                      Then it's up the stairs and
                      Off to bed and my little girl
                      Says I haven't had my story yet
                      Everything weighing on my mind
                      Disappears just like that
                      When she lifts her head
                      Off her pillow and says
                      I love you Dad I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry
                      I don't know why they say
                      Grown men don't cry
