 Staring at you taking off your makeup
                      Wondering why you even put it on
                      I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
                    Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone Chorus:
                      I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
                      Baby blue eyes and your head on my shoulder
                      Wait, baby don't move, right there it is
                      A T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
                      That river was cold but we gave love a chance
                      Yeah To me
                      You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
                      That sunset, riverbank, first time feeling Yeah smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
                      I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
                      Got Cougar up on ten, Little Diddy 'Bout Jack and Diane
                      You're laughing, singing with your feet up on the dash
                      Remember that Chorus:
                      I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
                      Baby blue eyes and your head on my shoulder
                      Wait, baby don't move, right there it is
                      A T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
                      That river was cold but we gave love a chance
                      Yeah To me
                      You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
                      That sunset, riverbank, first time feeling
