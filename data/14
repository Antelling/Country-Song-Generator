 (intro)
                      DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAAAAA
                    DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAAAA! Well, I walk into the room
                      Passing out hundred dollar bills
                      And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
                      And I buy the bar a double round of crown
                      And everybody's getting down 
                      An' this town ain't never gonna be the same. (Chorus:)
                      Cause I saddle up my horse
                      and I ride into the city
                      I make a lot of noise
                      Cause the girls
                      They are so pretty
                      Riding up and down Broadway
                      on my old stud Leroy
                      And the girls say
                      Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
                      Everybody says
                      Save a horse, Ride a cowboy Well I don't give a dang about nothing
                      I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
                      While the girls are drinking
                      Long necks down!
                      And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
                      or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
                      Or your freak parade
                      I'm the only John Wayne left in this town And I saddle up my horse
                      and I ride into the city
                      I make a lot of noise
                      Cause the girls
                      They are so pretty
                      Riding up and down Broadway
                      on my old stud Leroy
                      And the girls say
                      Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
                      Everybody says
                      Save a horse, Ride a cowboy  (Spoken:)
                      I'm a thourough-bred
                      that's what she said
                      in the back of my truck bed
                      As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
                      Out on some back country road.
                      We where flying high
                      Fining, whine, having ourselves a good and rich time
                      And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
                      But her evaluation
                      of my cowboy reputation
                      Had me begging for slavation
                      all night long
                      So I took her out kicking frogs
                      Introduced her to my old bird dog
                      And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of And we made love
                      And I saddled up my horse
                      and I ride into the city
                      I make a lot of noise
                      Cause the girls
                      They are so pretty
                      Riding up and down Broadway
                      on my old stud Leroy
                      And the girls say
                      Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
                      Everybody says
                      Save a horse, Ride a cowboy What? What?
                      Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
                      Everybody says
                      Save a Horse Ride a cowboy.
