 I watched him take the two strike call:
                      He hadn't tried to swing at all.
                      I guess he'd had all that he could take,
                      He walked away, for goodness sake.
                      His father's voice was loud an' mean:
"You won't amount to anything."  That little boy quit tryin',
                      He just walked away.
                      There were teardrops on his face.
                      Tell me, how would you feel?
                      You'd probably give up too,
                      If nobody believed in you.  That old man said: "One more try"
                    "I know I'm not too old to drive,
                    "I promise, son, I'll do my best,
                    "This time, I'm gonna pass the test."
                    "Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in."
                      His father never drove again.  That old man quit tryin',
                      He just turned away.
                      An' there were teardrops on his face.
                      Tell me, how would you feel?
                      You'd probably give up too,
                      If nobody believed in you.  We take His name out of schools.
                      The lawyers say it breaks the rules.
                      Pledge of allegiance can't be writ,
                      An' under God, should not be said.
                      I wonder how He will take.
                      I just pray it's not too late.  What if God quit tryin',
                      He just turned away?
                      There were teardrops on his face?
                      Tell me, how would you feel?
                      You'd probably give up too,
                      If nobody believed in you.  Tell me, how would you feel?
                      You'd probably give up too,
                      If nobody believed in you.
