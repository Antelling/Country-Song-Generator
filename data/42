 
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
with somebody twice
your size. . .
Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
  and I've been known to cause a few births
  I can make you new friends
  Or get you fired from work.
(Chorus)
  And since the day I left Milwaukee
  Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
  Been makin the bars
  With lots of big money
  and helpin white people dance
  I got you in trouble in high school
  and college now that was a ball
  you had some of the best times
  you'll never remember with me
  Alcohol, Alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
  for your best man's emberrasing speech
  and also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
  I've influenced kings and world leaders
  I helped Hemingway write like he did
  and I`ll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
  put that lampshade on your head . .
And since the day I left Milwaukee
  Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
  Been makin a fool out of folks
  just like you
  and helpin white people dance
  I am medicine and I am poison
  I can help you up or make you fall
  you had some of the best times
  you'll never remember with me
  Alcohol
And since the day I left Milwaukee
  Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
  Been makin the bars
  With lots of big money
  (crowd:) and helpin white people dance
  I got you in trouble in high school
  and college now that was a ball
  you had some of the best times
  you'll never remember with me
  Alcohol, Alcohol
 Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
  and I've been known to cause a few births
  I can make you new friends
  Or get you fired from work. (Chorus)
  And since the day I left Milwaukee
  Lyncheburg Bourbon, France
