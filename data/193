 It's not easy saying this to you
                      It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
                      But boy before you go
                    I want you to Know [Chorus]
                      I wish you strength
                      When times are hard
                      Oh I wish with all my heart you find just what
                      You're looking for
                      I wish you joy
                      I wish you peace
                      And that every star you see's within your reach
                      And I wish you still loved me I wish things were different you know that
                      But I'm still happy for the times we had
                      You mean the world to me
                      Baby Please Believe [Repeat Chorus] Losing you is tearing me apart
                      But a part of me will be with you
                      No matter where you are [Repeat Chorus]
