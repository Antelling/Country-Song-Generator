 Connie came back from her second cousin's wedding
                      First time she'd been home in 'bout a year or two
                      Just in time for the rehearsal dinner
                    But that crazy Connie wasn't wearing any shoes [Chorus]
                      She lives in L.A. she flies to New York City
                      That woman's been around the world
                      You can take that girl out of the honky tonk
                      But you can't take the honky tonk, can't take the honky tonk
                      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Well the dinner broke up at about 11:30
                      And the boys went off to do what boys will do
                      Connie said come here girls we need to huddle up
                      Around something that's a hundred proof [Repeat Chorus] It's nine a.m. in front of the church
                      People are going nuts just looking for the groom
                      And by the way where's Connie
                      She's run off with that boy in Cancun [Repeat Chorus]
