 
(feat. Whitney Duncan)
I didn't look over my shoulder
  I wasn't ready for this
  Didn't see the signs over the horizon
  I was so sure that you would never leave
  But you did 
So sweep away the sand, and tide, the ocean, and just 
  Pack the moon and stars up in a cardboard box, and
  Stop the clouds from chimin'
  Block the sun from shinin'
  Paint the sky a deeper shade of blue
  ?Cause my world's over without you
I know I should just keep goin'
  But I don't know where to start
  I never thought I'd see the day when
  You'd go and leave me here with my broken heart, 
  But you did
CHORUS
Maybe someday all the pain will fade
  Maybe this hurt will slowly slip away
  Maybe some days will never change
  And I'll still love you
Stop the clouds from chimin'
  Block the sun from shinin'
  Paint the sky a deeper shade of blue
  ?Cause my world's over without you
My world's over without you..
Stop the clouds from chimin'
  Stop the clouds from chimin'
  Block the sun from shinin'
  Block the sun from shinin'
