 
One more broken dreambut it don’t matter
If it seems your dreams are all shattered
New dreams come along,
And sometimes there just as strong as the one that’s gone
So don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
But you can live your life in sorrow
  Or move on to a new tomorrow
  And you can laugh about this place
  A different smile on a different face waits for you
  So don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
Everything you know is upside down
  Don’t you worry it will turn around
  Feelin lonely aint no crime
  And nothing heals like time
So don’t let the world pass by you
  Just leave all your cares behind you
  There’s a crossroad up ahead so be careful where you tread
  So be careful where you tread when you pass through
  And don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
  (lead)
When the world you know turns upside down
  Don’t you worry it will turn around
  Feelin lonely aint no crime
  And nothing heals like time
  (stop)
So just let the road pass by you
  Just leave all your cares behind you
  There’s a crossroad up ahead so be careful where you tread
  So be careful where you tread when you pass through
  And don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
  And don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
  Don’t be blue don’t be blue
 But you can live your life in sorrow
  Or move on to a new tomorrow
  And you can laugh about this place
  A different smile on a different face waits for you
  So don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue Everything you know is upside down
  Don’t you worry it will turn around
  Feelin lonely aint no crime
  And nothing heals like time So don’t let the world pass by you
  Just leave all your cares behind you
  There’s a crossroad up ahead so be careful where you tread
  So be careful where you tread when you pass through
  And don’t cry little angel little angel don’t be blue
