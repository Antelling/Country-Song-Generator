 Well I ain't never had a problem with California
                      There's a lot of good women, Sacramento to Corona
                      But them Hollywood types, after a while wear on ya
                      Strutin' around in their size zeros,
                      Skinny little girls no meat on thier bones
                    Never even heard of George Jones CHORUS
                      Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
                      Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
                      Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
                      Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls There ain't nothing wrong with plastic surgery
                      Well, Dolly Parton never looked so good to me
                      Everybody oughta be exactly who they want to be
                      But that Paris Hilton gets under my skin
                      With her big fake smile and her painted on skin
                      Never had a chance at a real man CHORUS
                      Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
                      Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
                      Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
                    Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls CHORUS
                      Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
                      Ain't you glad there's still a few of us left, who know how to rock your world
                      Ain't afraid to eat fried chicken and dirty dance to Merle
                    Ain't you glad we ain't no California girls
