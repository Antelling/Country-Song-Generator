 
When you change the way you look at things
The things you look at change
I can see the world so differently
Seeing things your way
There's a path that's right in front of me
That's been calling me for days
And I know that when you walk with me
It will be for always
You give me everything I have
  Everything I need
  You are the reason
  Why I believe
C H O R U S:
  All my love I want to give to you
  All my life I want to see you
  In my dreams you opened up my eyes
  To a world that I have never seen
  I'm coming home
When I see the way the early dawn
  drives the night away To reveal a world that's holding on
  To see a brighter day
  I can only hope for everyone
  To feel the way I do
  Live their life to love someone
  The way that I love you
  You give me everything I have
  Everything I need you are the reason why I believe
2nd C H O R U S
  All my love I want to give to you
  All my life I want to see you
  In my dreams you opened up a world That I have never seen
  For always I will remain faithful
  To the faith you have in me Can't believe how much I have grown
  With you I'm finally Coming Home
Through you I see the fight that will take me home All the days of my life
For always I will remain faithful
  To the faith you have in me Can't believe how much I have grown
  With you I'm finally Coming Home
