 Miss me baby
                      When you hear our favourite song,
                      Miss me baby
                      And when you start to sing along
                      Think about all the times that we danced
                      In moonlight to it all night long, oh
                    Then miss me baby. And want me honey,
                      Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
                      We couldn't wait anymore.
                      Left the keys in the door, took my hand
                      Pulled me down on the kitchen floor.
                      Yeah, we were that crazy
                      Then miss me baby. Chorus:
                      Because when he's holding you,
                      Know that it's killing me,
                      Let my memory be the reason girl
                      That you can't sleep
                      And everytime you feel his touch,
                      I pray to God it's not enough
                      And that I've touched your heart so deep
                      Girl, you can't shake me
                      Cause I love you,
                      Yes I need you,
                      Miss me baby. Miss me baby,
                      Until you can't take it no more
                      Miss me baby
                      Pack your bags and hit the door
                      I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me
                      Come back home
                      I'll be waiting
                      Right here waiting
                      Miss me baby. Chorus:
                      Because when he's holding you,
                      Know that it's killing me,
                      Let my memory be the reason girl
                      That you can't sleep
                      And everytime you feel his touch,
                      I pray to God it's not enough
                      And that I've touched your heart so deep
                      Girl, you can't shake me
                      Cause I love you,
                      Yes I need you,
                      Miss me baby. Everytime you hear this song,
                      Miss me baby...
