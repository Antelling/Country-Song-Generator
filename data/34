 It was just another story written on the second page
                      Underneath the Tiger's football score
                      It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
                    They found him face down on the bedroom floor There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
                      Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone... (Chorus)
                      How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
                      To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
                      Is better than the life that you had
                      How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
                    How do you get that lonely... and nobody know Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
                      Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
                      Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
                      Did no one see the writing on the wall? I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
                      I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand... (Chorus)
                      How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
                      To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
                      Is better than the life that you had
                      How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
                    How do you get that lonely... and nobody know It was just another story printed on the second page
