 Look at her
                      My God she's dancin'
                      Out there romancin'
                      In her new lover's arms
                      If he were here
                      To see how she's actin'
                      If he could hear her Laughin'
                    It would brak his broken heart [Chorus] 'Cause he ain't even cold yet
                      The tears haven't dried yet
                      It's not written in stone yet
                      As far as he's concerned
                      He ain't even cold yet
                      The fire's still burnin'
                      She laid his love to rest
                      Showin' no regrets
                      Lord, Heain't even cold yet If he found out 
                      Lord, It would kill him
                      'Cause he's still livin'
                      In yesterday
                      Whoever tells him
                      That she's not grieven'
                      Would just be leavin'
                      Flowers on his grave [Chorus] 'Cause he ain't even cold yet
                      The tears haven't dried yet
                      It's not written in stone yet
                      As far as he's concerned
                      He ain't even cold yet
                      The fire's still burnin'
                      She laid his love to rest
                      Showin' no regrets
                      Lord, Heain't even cold yet She laid his love to rest
                      Showin' no regrets
                    And he ain't even cold yet
