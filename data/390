 He said I was in my early forties 
                      with a lot of life before me 
                      when a moment came that stopped me on a dime 
                      and I spent most of the next days
                      looking at the x-rays 
                      Talking bout the options 
                      and talking bout sweet time
                      I asked him when it sank in 
                      that this might really be the real end 
                      how's it hit you when you get that kinda news 
                    man what'd you do  and he said
                      I went sky diving 
                      I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
                      I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu 
                      and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
                      and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying 
                      and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
                      to live like you were dying. He said I was finally the husband 
                      that most the time I wasn't 
                      and I became a friend a friend would like to have 
                      and all the sudden going fishin 
                      wasn't such an imposition 
                      and I went three times that year I lost my dad 
                      well I finally read the good book 
                      and I took a good long hard look 
                      at what I'd do if I could do it all again  and then 
                      I went sky diving 
                      I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
                      I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu 
                      and I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
                      and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying 
                      and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
                      to live like you were dying. Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about 
                      what'd you do with it what did you do with it 
                      what did I do with it 
                      what would I do with it'  Sky diving 
                      I went Rocky Mountain climbing 
                      I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named BluManchu 
                      and then I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter 
                      and I watched an eagle as it was flying 
                      and he said someday I hope you get the chance 
                      to live like you were dying.
                      To live like you were dying 
                      To live like you were dying
