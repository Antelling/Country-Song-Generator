 
When the thunder came
 With our flag in flames
 Everybody changed their color
 When the night became
 So dark with pain
 Everyone became a brother
 I came across the universe
 And I don't know why
 I came across the universe
 To hear a soldier cry
 Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody out there
   Is anybody out there
And the morning light
   Makes you wonder why
   You were ever born to see it
   When your body's cold
   It's not the story told
   To the brave young suols who believe it
They came across the battlefield
   And they son't know why
   They came across the universe
   To hear a soldier cry
Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody out there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody listening
   Is anybody out there
All his friends know he fears the end
   And he'll die for them if he had to
   Rise again
   Fall again
   In the end God will come to the rescue
Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody out there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody listening
   Is anybody out there
 Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody out there
   Is anybody out there And the morning light
   Makes you wonder why
   You were ever born to see it
   When your body's cold
   It's not the story told
   To the brave young suols who believe it They came across the battlefield
   And they son't know why
   They came across the universe
   To hear a soldier cry Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody out there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody listening
   Is anybody out there All his friends know he fears the end
   And he'll die for them if he had to
   Rise again
   Fall again
   In the end God will come to the rescue Is anybody out there
   Is anybody listening to my prayer
   Is anybody out there
   If you can hear me please take me out of here
   Is anybody listening
   Is anybody out there
