 (VERSE 1)
                      If I told you that I was wrong
                      and wanted you to come back home,
                      I'd be lying.
                      And if I said that we could work it out
                      and you shouldn't have any doubts,
                      I'd be lying.
                      And if I got down on my knees
                      in front of God above
                      and swore before the angels
                    I'd give you my love. (CHORUS)
                      I'd be lying next to you tonight
                      holding on with my whole life.
                      Right back where I belong.
                      Looking deep into your eyes
                      Man enough to realize
                      that honey, I was wrong.
                      If I could swallow my pride
                      and put myself in your shoes
                      and tell you that I understand
                      why you feel the way you do
                      then baby, I'd be lying...
                      I'd be lying next to you. (VERSE 2)
                      And if I told you that I loved you
                      and I put no one else above you,
                      I'd be lying.
                      And if I said you're the one for me
                      and I never set you free,
                      I'd be lying.
                      And if I somehow found the strength
                      to knock on your front door
                      and tell you face to face
                      I won't hurt you anymore. (CHORUS)
                      I'd be lying next to you tonight.
                      Holding on with my whole life.
                      Right back where I belong.
                      Looking deep into your eyes
                      Man enough to realize
                      that honey, I was wrong.
                      If I could swallow my pride
                      and put myself in your shoes
                      and tell you that I understand
                      why you feel the way you do.
                      Then baby, I'd be lying...
                      I'd be lying next to you. If I could swallow my pride
                      and put myself in your shoes
                      and tell you that I understand
                      why you feel the way you do.
                      Then baby, I'd be lying...
                      I'd be lying next to you. Next to you...
                      If I told you I was wrong...
                      If I said that we could work it out...
                      If I got down on my knees...
                      Oh baby, I'd be lying...
