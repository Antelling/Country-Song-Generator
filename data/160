 Heyahhhhhhhhh Five of the PM rolls around, there's a
                      little old joint outside of town
                      I only got time for a couple of beers and
                      a juke box song ringing in my ears
                      The next you know the bar tenders pouring, shots are flowing, got me stoning
                      All I really know is that I should be going,
                      but I'm soaking from the moment Am all jacked up, all jacked up
                      Don't believe I've ever had this much.
                      One thing I've learned when you get tore up
                      Time sure flies when you're all jacked up It was getting mighty close to nice o'clock,
                      what the hell I had one more shot.
                      Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar,
                      guess I mighta musta gone a little too far.
                      Cause a big ole girl walked outta the blue,
                      10 foot 2 with a bad attitude
                      Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth,
                      guess I had it coming I deserved the due Cos I was all jacked up, all jacked up,
                      Don't believe I've ever had this much.
                      One thing I've learned when you get tore up
                      Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up. Don't have to go home but you can't stay here,
                      That's what they said when I got my last beer.
                      Oh my God, its 2 o'clock, I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
                      So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window,
                      hurt my elbow got me in though
                      Two foot later backed into the light pole,
