 Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster
                      Than it did in the old days
                      So naturally we have more natural disasters
                    From the strain of a fast pace Sunday was the day of rest
                      Now its one more day for progress
                      But we can't slow down
                      Cause more is best
                      All in the process But I miss Mayberry
                      Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
                      Where everything was black & white
                      Pickin on a Six String
                      People pass by and you call them by their first name
                      Watching the clouds roll by
                      bye bye Sometimes I can hear this whole world stopping
                      Through the trees as the wind blows
                      Thats when I climb up here on this mountain
                      And look through God's window No I can't fly
                      I've got to be
                      To get me high up here
                      Far from the noise and city streets
                      My world receives the peace But I miss Mayberry
                      Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
                      Where everything was black & white
                      Pickin on a Six String
                      People pass by and you call them by their first name
                      Watching the clouds roll by
                      bye bye Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dark road
                      Not even listed on the map
                      I pass a dad and his son carrying a fishing poll
                      But I always wake up everytime I try to turn back But I miss Mayberry
                      Sittin on the porch drinking ice cold Cherry --- Coke
                      Where everything was black & white
                      Pickin on a Six String
                      People pass by and you call them by their first name
                      Watching the clouds roll by
                      bye bye
