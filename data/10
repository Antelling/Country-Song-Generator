 
If Heaven was an hour, it would be twilight,
  When the fireflies start their dancin' on the lawn;
  An' supper's on the stove and Mamma's laughin',
  And everybodys workin' day is done.
  If Heaven was a town, it would be my town,
    Oh, on a summer day in 1985.
    An' everything I wanted was out there waitin',
    And everyone I loved was still alive.
 Don't cry a tear for me, now, baby;
  There comes a time we all must say goodbye.
  And if that's what Heaven's made of,
  You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
If Heaven was a pie, it'd be cherry,
    So cool and sweet an' heavy on the tongue.
    An' just one bite would satisfy your hunger,
    An' there'd always be enough for everyone.
If Heaven was a train, it sure would be a fast one,
    That could take this weary traveller around the bend.
    If Heaven was a tear, it'd be my last one,
    An' you'd be in my arms again.
 Don't cry a tear for me, now, baby;
  There comes a time we all must say goodbye.
  And if that's what Heaven's made of,
  You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
 Yeah, if that's what Heaven's made of,
  You know, I, I ain't afraid to die.
