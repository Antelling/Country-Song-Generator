 There's a blue rocking chair
                      Sittin' in the sand
                      Weathered by the storms
                    And well oiled hands It sways back and forth
                      With the help of the winds
                      It seems to always be there
                      Like an old trusted friend I've read a lot of books
                      Wrote a few songs
                      Looked at my life
                      Where it's going, where it's gone I've seen the world through a bus windshield
                      But nothing compares
                      To the way that I see it
                      To the way that I see it
                      To the way that I see it
                      When I sit in that old blue chair From that chair I've caught
                      A few fish and some rays
                      And I've watched boats sail
                      In and out of Cinnamon Bay I let go of a lover
                      That took a piece of my heart
                      And prayed many times for forgiveness
                      And a brand new start I've read a lot of books
                      Wrote a few songs
                      Looked at my life
                      Where it's going, where it's gone I've seen the world through a bus windshield
                      But nothing compares
                      To the way that I see it
                      To the way that I see it
                      To the way that I see it
                      When I sit in that old blue chair That chair was my bed one New Year's night
                      When I passed out from too much Malibu
                      And I woke up to a hundred mosquito bites, I swear
                      Got 'em all sitting right there
                      In that old blue chair There's a blue rocking chair
                      Sittin' in the sand
                      Weathered by the storms
                      And well oiled hands.
