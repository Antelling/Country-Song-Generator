 Dear God
I hat to be a bother, but I gotta say
This world is getting crazier with every day
I hope You�ll hear me out now as I stop and pray
Dear God
  People take Your words and try to twist �em round
  I know You can�t be happy with what�s goin� down
  I�m searchin� for some answers, but they can�t be found
  Can You help me out, dear God
Dear God,
  Just the other night I heard somebody say
  What�s the use believin� in You anyway
  I guess it was just heartache talkin� through the pain
  It�s a cryin� shame
Dear God,
  I know You�re disappointed in the things we�ve done
  Can�t they see the truth that they�re all running from
  Try to preach You message with a loaded gun
  What they thinkin� of, Dear God
Everybody�s searching for an easy solution
  They can�t see beyond, the selfish world they�re living in
  Your words of love get lost, in all the confusion
  But I still believe, someday You�re gonna speak to me
Dear God,
  I know You�ve got a million other calls to take
  You�re dealing with a lot of things that just won�t wait
  But there is one request that I just gotta make
Dear God
  Won�t You send a sign down, just to ease my doubt
  I�m trying to hear You, but the silence is so loud
  I think I see a rainbow from behind the clouds
  And I hear You now, dear God.
