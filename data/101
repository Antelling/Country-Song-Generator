 
When she picked up the telephone
His voice came on the line
She said this can't be happening
And tears fell from her eyes
She said 'What am I supposed to do
I can't handle losing you?'
He said 'I just had to call and say goodbye
One last time'
He said 'There are some things in this life
  That are out of our control
  Like who we fall in love with
  And when it's time to go'
She said 'What about the plans we had'
  He said 'This connection's gettin' bad
  Now, c'mon baby let me hear you smilev One last time'
She started to apologize for 
  All the things that she'd done wrong
  She said 'I would've loved you better
  If only I'd known'
He said 'You were the perfect wife
  Promise me you'll go on with your life'
  She says 'The boys won't understand'
  He says 'Tell them Daddy loves them and Be strong'
He said 'Hon, I've gotta go'
  She said 'Don't you dare hang up
  There's so many things I need to say
"I love you so much"
It was almost like she felt him leave
  She cried out 'Can you still hear me' 
  She fell down on the kitchen floor 
  When the signal died 
  As the pilot tried to pull out of the dive 
  One Last ....
