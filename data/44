 I talked to my sister in Memphis,
                      And told her you were movin' to town.
                      Here's her number,
                      She said she'd be glad to show you around.
                      Well, I left a map on your front seat,
                      Just in case you lose your way.
                      But don't worry, 
                      Once you reach Sallisaw it's all interstate.
                      I know you need to go.
                      But before you do, I want you to know: That I wish you the best.
                      And I wish you nothing less,
                      Than everything you've ever dreamed of.
                      And I hope that you find love along the way.
                      But most of all, I wish you'd stay. I figure right about sundown,
                      You'll be in West Tennessee.
                      And by then, 
                      Maybe, I'll understand, why you had to leave.
                      I know that you've done some changin',
                      And I know there's no changin' your mind.
                      Yes I know,
                      We've been through this a thousand times.
                      I'm sorry for still holdin' on;
                      I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong.  And I wish you the best.
                      And I wish you nothing less,
                      Than everything you've ever dreamed of.
                      I hope that you find love along the way.
                      Most of all, I wish you'd stay. Yes, everything you've ever dreamed of.
                      And I hope that you find love along the way.
                      But most of all, I wish you'd stay.
                      I wish you'd stay. Instrumental Fade Out.
