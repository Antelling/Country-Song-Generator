 Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
                      How's about cookin' something up with me?
                      Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe,
                    We could find us a brand new recipe.  I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill,
                      An' I know a spot right over the hill.

                      Instrumental Break.  I'm free and I'm ready, maybe we can go steady.
                      How's about savin' all your time for me?
                      No more lookin', I know I've been took in:

                      'Cause I'm writin' your name down on ev'ry page.  Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?
