 put me on a mountain way back in the backwoods
                      put me on a lake with a big'n on the line
                      put me round a campfire cookin somethin i just cleaned
                    you do your thing I'll do mine i aint tradin in my family's safety
                      just to save on a little gas
                      and I'll pray to god any place, any time
                      and you can bet I'll pick up the phone if uncle sam calls me up
                      you do your thing I'll do mine (chorus)
                      hey I'll worry bout me
                      you just worry about you
                      and I'll believe what i believe
                      and you can believe what you believe to i aint gonna spare the rod
                      cause that aint what my daddy did
                      and i sure know the difference between wrong and right
                      you know to me its all just common sense
                      a broken rule a consequence
                      you do your thing I'll do mine (chorus) im gonna keep on workin
                      make my money the old fashioned way
                      i dont want a piece of someone else's pie
                      if i dont get my fill on life i aint gonna blame no one but me
                      you do your thing I'll do mine you aint gonna be my judge
                      cause my judge will judge us all one day
                      you do your thing I'll do mine
