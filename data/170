 Rebel Child.....
Rebel Child, won’t you heed my warning…
   One of these days the rain will come pouring
   Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings…might just turn to gray
I understand, why you do the things you do
   There was a time, when I was just like you
   I know right now, you think you know it all
   There’s no way that you can break, no way you can fall
Rebel Child, won’t you heed my warning
   One of these days the rain will come pouring
   Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings, might just turn to gray…
Cuz I’ve been there and I know what your thinking
   You’re flying high but someday you’ll blink and
   That cloud you're on will just start sinking
   Don’t wait ‘til it’s too late.
Oh, oh, oh Rebel Child
I know you can’t learn from my mistakes
   You got your own… roads you gotta take
   And they might look… like they’re paved with gold
   Just remember that you’ll have to reap… all the seeds you sow
Rebel Child, won’t you heed my warning…
   One of these days the rain will come pouring…
   Some of those sunshine blue, sky mornings might just turn to gray…
I’ve been there and I know what your thinking
   You’re flying high, but someday you’ll blink and
   That cloud you're on will just start sinking
   Don’t wait ‘til it’s too late.
Oh, oh, oh Rebel Child
   Oh, oh, oh Rebel Child
Keep your feet on the ground, one on eye on heaven
   Do a lot of forgiving, not much forgetting
   And remember life is one big lesson
Rebel Child won’t you heed my warning…
