 
You never looked more beautiful
Than you look tonight
In your eyes I see all I can be
And how you changed my life
You held on when I let go
Now all I want is to let you know
C H O R U S
Your love is like a river
  It runs through my heart and soul
  It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
  And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore
  And find peace of mind time after time
  You give me everything and more
When tomorrow comes I will face the morning
  In a different light
  You can change your mind a thousand times
  Nothing will ever change mine 'cause
C H O R U S
The sun will rise and the light will shine
  Everything will be alright
  Oh, yes it will 'cause
C H O R U S
Your love is like a river
  It runs through my heart and soul
  It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
  And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore
  And find peace of mind time after time
  You give me everything and more
 C H O R U S Your love is like a river
  It runs through my heart and soul
  It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
  And when I feel forgotten I come runnin' to your shore
  And find peace of mind time after time
  You give me everything and more When tomorrow comes I will face the morning
  In a different light
  You can change your mind a thousand times
  Nothing will ever change mine 'cause C H O R U S The sun will rise and the light will shine
  Everything will be alright
  Oh, yes it will 'cause C H O R U S Your love is like a river
  It runs through my heart and soul
  It's deep when I'm thristy and warm when I'm cold
