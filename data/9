 He was a bad boy and I was a good girl
                      He needed me to smooth out the edges
                      He'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
                      After two years of his crap I quit begging 
                      I'm a magnet for the fixer upper man
                    If I know it's fire, why do I let it burn my hand Cupid works for the devil
                      Be suspicious if he cries
                      You know sex is usually good
                      Yeah, but it ain't always right
                      Chocolate is a band-aid and no matter what they say
                      Shoes don't stretch and men don't change My friend Lisa, she loves a liar
                      She found about his other girlfriends
                      He makes excuses so she forgives him
                      She swears she's gonna leave if he screws up again
                      But he's good looking, that's why she don't see
                      He's got her exactly where he wants her to be
 (Repeat Chorus)
 I just met a brand new guy
                      So far so good
                      iIhope he don't change at all (Repeat Chorus)
