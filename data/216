 Friday night and the moon is high
                      I'm wide-awake just watchin' you sleep
                      And I promise you you're gonna have
                      More than just the things that you need
                      We ain't got much now, We're just startin' out
                    But I know somehow paradise is comin' [Chorus:]
                      Someday baby, You and I are gonna be the ones
                      Good luck's gonna shine
                      Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
                      So hold on
                      We're headed for a better life Oh now there's a place for you and me
                      Where we can dream as big as the sky
                      I know it's hard to see it now
                      But baby someday we're gonna fly
                      This road we're on, you know it might be long
                      But my faith is strong
                      It's all that really matters [Chorus:]
                      Someday baby, You and I are gonna be the ones
