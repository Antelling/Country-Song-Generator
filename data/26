 
Is this my bed
 What's goin' on in my head
 I fell so different today
 I have this image of you
 My freedom, my courage, the strength I never knew
 I found the answer through you
 Discovered the glory of living through you
 You taught me so much
 Your words lift me up
 I'm not me anymore
   I'm all of us and a part of you
   I'm not me anymore
   I'm here for you
   With every beat of my heart
   I come closer to you
I have this vision of you
   My kindness, my faith
   I attribute to you
   I share my secrects with you
   You taught me forgivness with all that you do
   To have someone you trust can change you so much
C H O R U S:
   Closer than
   I've ever been to knowing your love never ends
   And even when my heart is aching
   Knowing that you'll take me in
   And love me again
C H O R U S
 I'm not me anymore
