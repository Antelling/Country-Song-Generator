 Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile, he n Mary making her way into the
                      night, you can here the cries from the carnival rides, the pin ball bills, ski ball slides,
                      watching the summer sun fall out of scent, there’s a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
                      making its way past the hotel wall to fill the streets Mary is holding both of her shoes in
                      her hands said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet  And in the morning I’m leaving n making my way back to Cleveland so tonight I hope I would do
                      just fine, and I don’t see how you could ever be anything but mine  There’s a local band playing at the sea side pavilion and I got just enough cash to get us in
                      and as we are dancing Mary’s wrapping her arms around me and I cant feel the sting on summer
                      on my neck in the mist of the music I tell her I love her, we both laugh cause it isn’t true
                      but Mary there is a summer drawing to tonight there’s so much I’m longing to do to you  And in the morning I’m leaving n making my way back to Cleveland so to night I hope I would
                      do just fine n I don’t see how you could ever be anything but mine Ooooooooo.. And in the morning I’m leaving n making my way back to Cleveland so to night I hope I would
                      do just fine n I don’t see how you could ever be anything but mine Mary I don’t see how you could ever be anything but mine  Ooooooooooo...ooooooooooooooo... ...And in the morning I’m leaving n making my way back to Cleveland so to night I hope I would
                      do just fine n I don’t see how you could ever be anything but mine
