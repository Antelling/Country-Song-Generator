 When I gave you my heart
It was not what you wanted
Now the walls say your name
And the pictures are haunted
Does my ring burn your finger
  Did my love weigh you down
  Was a promise to much
  To keep around
I remember your words
  And I can�t keep from crying
  I could never believe
  That your kisses were lying
  Was there something from the past
  Buried in a shallow grave
  Did you thing that it was too far gone to save
Please tell me baby
  Please tell me now
  You say that I should just go on
  Now please tell me how
Now it�s just me and the night
  And I�m so broken hearted
  I just wait in the dark here
  For my dearly departed
Does my ring burn your finger
  Did my love weigh you down
  Was a promise to much
  To keep around
 Does my ring burn your finger
  Did my love weigh you down
  Was a promise to much
  To keep around I remember your words
  And I can�t keep from crying
  I could never believe
  That your kisses were lying
  Was there something from the past
  Buried in a shallow grave
  Did you thing that it was too far gone to save Please tell me baby
  Please tell me now
  You say that I should just go on
  Now please tell me how Now it�s just me and the night
  And I�m so broken hearted
  I just wait in the dark here
  For my dearly departed Does my ring burn your finger
  Did my love weigh you down
  Was a promise to much
  To keep around
