 I just want you close
  Where you can stay forever
  You can be sure
  That it will only get better You and me together
  Through the days and nights
  I don't worry 'cause
  Everything's going to be alright
  People keep talking they can say what they like
  But all I know is everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
  No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I feel for you When the rain is pouring down
  And my heart is hurting
  You will always be around
  This I know for certain You and me together
  Through the days and nights
  I don't worry 'cause
  Everything's going to be alright No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
  No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I feel I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
  So till the end of time, oh No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I feel for you
  No one, no one, no one
  Can get in the way of what I'm feeling No one
  Can get in the way of what I feel for you
  I just want you close
  Where you can stay forever
