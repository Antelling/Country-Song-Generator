 I never once, backed down from a punch.
                      I'd take it square on the chin.
                      Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to
                      stand up to him.
                      So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt
                      I just grinned.
                      But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
                      They turn into big babies again.
                      Scared me to death when took your first steps,
                      Well I'd fall everytime you fell down.
                      Your first day of school, 
                      I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town.
                      Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died 
                      at least not in front of my friends.
                      But when tough little boys grow up to be
                      Dads they turn into big babies again.
                      Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am.
                      Well sometimes it's hard to believe,
                      One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify
                      me.
                      If you were to ask my wife would just laugh ,
                      she'd say I know all about men,
                      how tough little boys grow up to be Dads 
                      they turn into big babies again.
                      Well I know one day I'll give you away 
                      and I'm goin to stand there and smile.
                      When I get home and I'm all alone,
                      I'll sit in your room for awhile.
                      Cause when tough little boys grow up to be
                      Dads they turn into big babies again
