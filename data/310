 

I was 18 makin' minimum wage
With a letterman jacket and a Chevrolet
thought I was cool
yeah I ruled the school
You were coolatta with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Our senior year, I was your daddy's worst fear
We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left hand rings would make everything alright
With a little bit o' live, little bit o' learn
Little bit o' watchin' a few more candles burn
And findin' out what life was
With a little bit o' fuss little bit o' fight
Little bit o' kiss and makin' up all night
And wide awake in love, oh in a real love
Well I was 22 workin' double overtime
I was spendin' dollars and makin' dimes
I was overdrawn, barely hangin' on
Then one night you came to me
Tears in your eyes and the EPD and said "guess what"
Baby ready or not
Well I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna' raise a kid when I'm only a kid myself
With a little bit o' live, little bit o' learn
Little bit o' watchin' a few more candles burn
And findin' out what life was
With a little bit o' fuss little bit o' fight
Little bit o' kiss and makin' up all night
And wide awake in love, oh in a real love
