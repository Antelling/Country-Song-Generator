 Spent the night with Jim Beam and Johnny Walker Red, 
Woke up with a freight train runnin' through my head, 
Ohh I'm a beer man... 
Bobby's more the wine kind, 
Donny does his shots; 
Sammy sips martinis, 
Willy smokes pot, 
but I'm a beer man...
I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb, 
  but my open mind winds up closed again, 
  I like brown bottles and aluminum cans, 
  Simple maybe... 
  but that's who I am... 
  Hey I'M JUST A BEER MAN. 
Take your caviar and that fish that ain't cooked, 
  take if off a cracker and throw it on a hook, 
  I'm a beer man... 
  Oh and if I was a rich man tell ya what I'd do, 
  I'd be the same old, plain old, guy you always knew, 
  just a beer man... 
I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb, 
  but my open mind winds up closed again, 
  I like brown bottles and aluminum cans, 
  Call me simple ... 
  but that's who I am... 
  Hey I'M JUST A BEER MAN. 
Yeah - I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb, 
  but my open mind winds up closed again, 
  I like brown bottles and aluminum cans, 
  Call me simple ... 
  but I can't change who I am... 
  Whoa I'M JUST A BEER MAN. 
  Yeah... I'm a beer man... I've done a little steppin' out there on a limb, 
  but my open mind winds up closed again, 
  I like brown bottles and aluminum cans, 
  Simple maybe... 
  but that's who I am...
