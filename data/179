 
You like the way that sounds?
Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin’ up his Bronco 
  He’s gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull 
  All the girls are getting’ pretty sprayin’ on the White Rain 
  Yeah they’re gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game 
  Yeah 
Chorus: 
  We let it rip when we got the money 
  Let it roll if we got the gas 
  It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down 
  In a Hicktown 
Well you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles 
  And his woman’s’ smokin’ Pall Mall’s watchin’ Laura Ingles 
  And Granny’s getting’ lit she’s headin’ out to bingo 
  Yeah my buddies and me are goin’ muddin’ down on Blue Hole Road 
  You know You know 
Chorus: 
  We let it rip when we got the money 
  Let it roll if we got the gas 
  It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down 
  In a Hicktown 
(Bridge) 
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars 
  And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars 
  Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco 
  And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio 
Chorus 
  We let it rip when we got the money 
  Let it roll if we got the gas 
  It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down 
  Oh Oh We let it rip when we got the money 
  Let it roll if we got the gas 
  Its buck wild yeah but that’s the way we get down 
  In a Hicktown 
  In a Hicktown 
  It’s the way we get down 
  In a Hicktown 
  Yeah in a Hicktown 
Oh we aint finished yet 
  We got yer country boys and yer redneck girls 
  It’s the party heard round the world 
  Right here in Hicktown 
  Yeah In Hicktown 
  The whole town’s gettin’ down
