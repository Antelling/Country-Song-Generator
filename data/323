 Last night you gave me a kiss 
                      You didn't know it, but I was awake when you did 
                      You were quiet, you were gonna let me sleep 
                      So I just laid there pretending to be 
                      You said some things you didn't know I could hear 
                      And the words "I love you" never sounded so sincere  [Chorus]
                      It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving 
                      Now that I know just how much you care 
                      You finally gave me one good reason not to go 
                      But staying here is my worst fear  This morning I rolled out of bed 
                      Recalling all the sweet things you said 
                      This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad 
                      Called out your name, but you didn't answer back 
                      I searched the house to find out what was wrong 
                      Like a ton of bricks, it hit me you were gone  [Repeat Chorus] [Bridge]
                      All along I knew that there was something missing 
                      And only one thing left to do 
                      I had to leave behind this life that we'd been living 
                      But the only thing that left was you  [Second Chorus]
                      It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving
                      Now that I know just how much you care
                      You finally gave me one good reason not to go
                      But being alone is my worst fear
                      And staying here is my worst fear
