 I bet you've never heard ole Marshall Dillion say
                      Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
                      Settling down will you marry me
                      If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please
                      She'd of said Yes in a New York minute
                      They never tied the knot
                      His heart wasn't in it
                      Stole a kiss as he road away
                    He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place I should've been a Cowboy
                      I should'be learned to rope and ride
                      Wearing my six-shooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
                      Stealing the young girl's hearts
                      Just like Gene and Roy
                      Singing those campfire songs
                      I should've been a cowboy I might of had a side kick with a funny name
                      Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
                      Ending up on the brink of danger
                      Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
                      Go west yound man, haven't you been told
                      California's full of whisky, women and gold
                      Sleeping out all night beneath the Texas stars
                      Dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart I should've been a Cowboy
                      I should'be learned to rope and ride
                      Wearing my six-shooter riding by pony on a cattle drive
                      Stealing the young girl's hearts
                      Just like Gene and Roy
                      Singing those campfire songs
                      I should've been a cowboy
