 She thinks I walk on water 
                      She thinks I hung the moon 
                      She tells me every mornin' 
                      They just don't make men like you 
                      She thinks I've got it together 
                      She swears I'm as tough as nails 
                      But I dont have the heart to tell her 
                      She don't know me that well

                      (Chorus) 
                      She don't know how much I need her 
                      She don't know I'd fall apart 
                      Without her kiss 
                      Without her touch 
                      Without her faithful lovin' arms 
                      She don't know that its all about her 
                      She don't know I cant live without her 
                      She's my world she's my everything 
                      And she thinks she needs me

                      Sometimes she cries on my shoulder 
                      When she's lyin next to me 
                      But she don't know that when I hold her 
                      That she's really holdin' me
                      Holdin me

                      (Chorus) 
                      She don't know how much I need her 
                      She don't know I'd fall apart 
                      Without her kiss 
                      Without her touch 
                      Without her faithful lovin' arms 
                      She don't know that its all about her 
                      She don't know I cant live without her 
                      She's my world she's my everything 
                      And she thinks she needs me

                      And the funny thing is 
                      She thinks she's the lucky one

                      (Chorus) 
                      She don't know how much I need her 
                      She don't know I'd fall apart 
                      Without her kiss 
                      Without her touch 
                      Without her faithful lovin' arms 
                      She don't know that its all about her 
                      She don't know I cant live without her 
                      She's my world she's my everything 
                    And she thinks she needs me

                      She thinks I walk on water 
                    She thinks I hung the moon
