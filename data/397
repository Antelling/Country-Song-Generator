 She said, "ive seen you in here before."
                      I said, "Ive been here at ime or two."
                      She said, "Hello, my
                      name is bobby jo
                      meet my twin sister Better Lou
                      and we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
                      and you're the only cowboy in this place
                      and if you're up for a rodeo
                      we'll put a big Texas smile on
                      your face"
                    i said, "Girls," [Chorus]
                      i aint as good as i once was
                      i got a few years on me now
                      but there was a time back in my prime when i could really lay it down
                      and if you need some love tonight
                      then i might have just enough
                      i aint as good as i once was
                      but im as good once as i ever was i still hang out with my best friend dave
                      ive known him since we were kids at school
                      last night he
                      had a shots
                      got in a tight spot hustlin' a game of pool
                      with a couple of readneck boys
                      one great
                      big bad biker man
                      i heard David yell across the room
                    "hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand."
                      i said, "Dave," [Chorus]
                      i aint as good as i once was
                      my how the years have flown
                      but there was a time back in my prime whne i could really hold my own
                      but if you wanna fight tonight
                      guess thouse boys dont look all that
                      tough

                      but im as good once as i ever was i used to be hell on wheels
                      back when i was younger man
                      now my body says, "you cant do this boy" but my pride says, "oh, yes you can i aint as good as i once was
                      thats just the cold hard truth
                      i still throw a few back, talk a little smack
                      when im feelin bullet proof
                      so dont double dog dare me now

                      but im as good once as i ever was
