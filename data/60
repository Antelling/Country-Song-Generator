 I keep having these disturbing dreams:
                    My final days, the end of me.
                    For some odd reason, I get one last wish,
                    And every time, I wish for this: 
                    Take me fast or take me slow.
                    I don't really care how I go.
                    In the daylight or in the dark,
                    Just don't let me die of a broken heart. 
                    The kind of pain that you just can't take,
                    Will send a strong man to his grave.
                    There's not a pill that can give you a rest,
                    Or fill that hole deep in your chest. 
                    So, take me fast or take me slow.
                    I don't really care how I go.
                    In the daylight or in the dark,
                    Just don't let me die of a broken heart.
                    No. 
                    Instrumental break.
                    (Yeah, yeah.
                    (Yeah, Yeah.) 
                    I've been crushed by that hurt before.
                    There's no way I could take any more.
                    If I fell in love, and I found out it would happen again,
                    I'd say take me now. 
                    And take me fast or take me slow.
                    I don't really care how I go.
                    In the daylight or in the dark,
                    Just don't let me die of a broken heart. 
                    Take me fast or take me slow.
                    I don't really care how I go.
                    In the daylight or in the dark,
                    Just don't let me die of a broken heart. 
                    No, don't let me die of a broken heart. 
                    No.
